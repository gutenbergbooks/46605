</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> is now a commonplace of criticism
that the epoch of Charles II.
was an epoch of decline and
degradation for the British drama.
The complacent self-felicitations
of Dryden in his early days on the superior refinement
of his own age, and the consequent superiority
of his own plays to those of Elizabeth and James,
dispose us to insist upon the contrary view
with somewhat emphatic asperity. Yet later,
Dryden did ample justice to "the giant race
before the flood"&mdash;the pre-rebellion poets, by
himself so named&mdash;expressly repudiating French
influence moreover. Indeed, the great wave of
dramatic energy had culminated, and was subsiding.
The age so extolled by Dryden was, in
many respects, unfavourable to dramatic poetry.
The Puritan, with his grave, earnest tone, righteous
indignation against evil living, and crude, sour,
uncultivated other-worldliness, had dehumanized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
the people, frowning upon art, beauty, and secular
knowledge, till they withered and dwindled, as
under a blight; so that religious reverence became
identified with blind intolerance, virtue and high
principle with clownish ignorance and pharisaic
cant.</p>

<p>Then, after the Restoration&mdash;(partly through
that tendency to reaction from extremes which
characterizes human nature, partly through the
direction given to our stage by a dissolute and
light king, who had lived an exile at a court where
he and his courtiers, besides acquiring foreign
tastes, might well learn disuse, and forget the
habit of patriotism)&mdash;not only a wide-spread
sexual license, but a very general social and political
corruption prevailed in England. The
troublous period of the civil wars, moreover,
besides leaving little leisure for the graces of
life and courtship of the Muses, had engendered a
certain ferocity and violence of tone in political
and social relations; the war thunders and commotions
still growled and grumbled, heaved and
seethed in the sullen subsiding swell of bitter
and furious faction&mdash;religious fanaticism on the
one hand, incredulity and moral indifference on
the other. Our very patriotism was tainted with
venality. And though some splendid naval victories
adorned the reign, though a few names, for
ever illustrious in our annals, shine like stars
from among dark and turbulent clouds, it was a
time when our buffoon king bartered the liberties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
of his country for gold of a foreign prince, invoking
alien aid against his own subjects; when the Dutch
admiral sailed by silent and dismantled forts up
our chief river and burned our ships; when
Clarendon, the historian, the Tory statesman of
high reputation, grovelling at the Council board
before the divine right of Stuarts, proclaimed
eagerly his longing to embrace dishonour, and
sacrifice his own daughter at the shrine of that
terrible idol; when the shrewd and subtle Liberal
statesman, Shaftesbury, emulating Machiavelli,
deserved the scathing invective inflicted by
Dryden upon Achitophel. Shall we compare
such a middle age of declining manhood, though
not shorn indeed of all glory, with that of
Elizabeth in the generous splendour and faulty
exuberance of adventurous youth? The purple
glow of health and morning had well-nigh faded
from this dim world.</p>

<p>Still we must not exaggerate the loss. Power
and passion were yet with us. The spell and
memory of great traditions, historical and literary,
were yet upon us. I do think that our most
recent writers have been unjust to the Restoration
drama. The brightest glories of that period indeed
are unquestionably of Puritan growth, the fruit
of Humanism and Renascence grafted upon the
sturdy stock of pious Puritan principle, Milton's
<i>Paradise</i>, and <i>Comus</i>, arrayed in magnificent
language, sumptuous like cloth of gold; austere
<i>Samson</i>, our only great native recreation (no mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
clever imitation) of an old-world tragedy, because
the work of a genius, devout as &AElig;schylus, alive,
moreover, with the personal experience of an illustrious
personality; and Bunyan's wonderful vision,
clad in a lovely homespun of purest English, solace
of devout souls for all time, delight of young and
old, wise and simple, rich and poor&mdash;healing aromatic
balsam these from the still Puritan garden.
Yet without this pale too, in the confused common
world, in the sphere of rich and gracious secular
poetry, there are two names at least that we
cannot afford to forget&mdash;the names of Dryden
and Otway. Two great human tragedies, <i>Don</i>
<i>Sebastian</i>, and <i>All for Love</i>, besides one fine, though
inferior tragi-comedy, <i>The Spanish Friar</i>, and the
rhymed heroic plays, abounding in true poetry
and skilful characterisation, has Dryden written;
while Otway, who lived so miserably and died so
young, produced three dramas of high calibre, one
of which, <i>Venice Preserved</i>, is surpassed in the
modern world only by Shakespeare. If those were
the days of Lauderdale and Jefferies, they were
capable also of nourishing the religious life of
Leighton, Fox and Penn; the philosophy of
Cudworth and Henry More, of Hobbes, Locke,
Boyle and Newton; the narrative of Defoe; the
satire of Butler; the history, and memoirs of
Clarendon, Burnet, Fuller and Evelyn; finally,
the excellent poetry of Andrew Marvell&mdash;leaving
aside that thinner, weaker, more popular vein of
Waller and Cowley; while even though Herrick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
was gone, Rochester and Sedley could write a song.
After all, the flood of national life still flowed strong,
albeit turbid and troubled, still bursting through
old worn barriers, irresistibly seeking, and with
whatever delays securing health and freedom for all.
Even the pulse of high Tories must have glowed
when they remembered the European position of
England under the Commonwealth; while Dryden
was born a Puritan, though he died a Catholic,
and had written an ode to Cromwell.</p>

<p>It is alleged, however, that the French drama had
at this time (Scott says through the French taste
of Charles II.) a baneful influence upon our own.
But I cannot assent to this position. I believe
rather that its influence was salutary, seeing that
our drama never lost its own pronounced national
character. On Dryden's earlier manner indeed,
the fashionable French (or old Latin) declamation,
casuistical debates about passion, and academic
coldness may have been somewhat injurious.
But this is a note rather of Dryden's idiosyncrasy
than that of a school, like his neatly-turned, sense-isolating
couplets&mdash;mannerisms shaken off by
Dryden himself in his later plays.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Who can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>less French than Lee? Otway also is perfectly
free from these faults; nor, except in his earliest
play, <i>Alcibiades</i>, is there any of Dryden's rant and
bombast. His fable, indeed, is classical in its
simplicity and skilful development; his concentration
on some one motive of action, involving
the utmost intensity of feeling, is unsurpassed;
his movement fierce and rapid; and that without
sacrificing underplot, or the grotesque element
characteristic of the romantic drama, as written
by Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Nor can
I grant that such concentration and unity of
interest, derived from classical examples, was
otherwise than a reform much needed in our
romantic tragedy&mdash;seeing it entailed no languor
or frigidity borrowed from Seneca, or the courtly
decorum of a French academy. On the extravagant
Gothic <i>fougue</i> and fury of our native stage,
characterised by its bad artistic form, and tumid,
fantastic diction, classical influence of the right
kind was purely salutary&mdash;granting, of course, the
presence of original genius, lacking, for instance,
in Addison's <i>Cato</i>&mdash;although I fully admit with
Schlegel that in the most perfect Shakespearean
examples of romantic drama the virtues of ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>and modern poetry are combined. Mr. J. A.
Symonds is unquestionably justified in his strictures
on Marlowe's learned predecessors, Norton,
Hughes, Sackville and Daniel as "pseudo-classical"
in <i>Gorboduc</i>, and elsewhere. But then they
followed the bad example of Seneca and his Italian
imitators. Dryden and Otway returned to more
legitimate classical methods.</p>

<p>Otway reminds us of the best Greek tragedies
by the intense furnace-breath of his passion,
and its headlong rush into the abyss of Fate,
though his poetry may be more volcanic and
perturbed. Modern romantic love is the Englishman's
theme, while in the religious atmosphere,
and stately ideal repose of Greek tragedy his
work is entirely wanting. But is not irreligion
a distinctive note of romantic Christian
drama, even as religion is that of the Greek?
True it is that Christianity has opened to us the
Infinite, and made us dissatisfied with the visible
world; true also that the ideal of individual
character has been heightened and purified in the
advance of civilisation under Christian auspices,
and that this feeling after the Infinite, this dissatisfaction
with life, this heightened ideal of
manhood, together with a deeper and wider comprehension
of humanity, may be found in the
drama of Shakespeare. Yet what of <i>religion</i> is
there in <i>Hamlet</i>, in <i>Lear</i>, in <i>Othello</i>? "The rest
is silence"&mdash;that is the final word. What reconciliation,
or attempt at vindication, of the ways of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
God to man? Perhaps the most religious of old
English plays is the <i>Faustus</i> of Marlowe, who is
reported to have been an atheist! For we can
hardly count the medi&aelig;val Miracles and Moralities.
But in Racine and Calderon, on the other
hand, you find again the religious atmosphere.
However, Dekker, Heywood and Jonson are moralised
in the best (and that no merely copy-book)
sense, and Shakespeare sometimes, as in <i>Macbeth</i>.
The Greeks took a familiar, majestic, semi-mythological
history, in which Divine interference had
ever been recognised, and the French tragedian
took kindred themes. But in Otway's drama,
while he adopted the classical unity of motive
and harmony of artistic treatment, for moral order
there is a dissonant clash, a confused shriek, a
wail of pain. In Shakespeare, there are many
noble axioms about living, many wise and religious
meditations; but none here. Shakespeare is a
broad beneficent river, life-giving, though lost in
a boundless, bottomless deep; Otway is a turbid
winter torrent, with the sob and moan of anguished,
stifled human love in it, whirling us to a catastrophe
without hope. Strange that <i>this</i> should be
the outcome of Christian, and that of Pagan
poetry! The truth is that the modern dramatic
poets had largely shaken off their Christianity,
just as Euripides had shaken off his Paganism.</p>

<p>At the same time, the best modern drama does
make us feel the moral influence, for good or evil,
of experience upon character, and the inevitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
issues in experience of character reacting upon
circumstance. Otway (in his more limited sphere)
does this, I think, as well as Shakespeare. Both
leave us with a warmer affection for goodness.
Carlos and the queen are noble and generous in
their unmerited suffering, and Philip suffers for
his fault.</p>

<p>Otway is classical in that he discovers a few
principal groups of vividly portrayed figures,
while the rest are very dim and subordinate.
But he is romantic in that his personages are
domestic, only dignified by their emotion.
Dryden's flow is broader and statelier, but not
so irresistibly compelling. In Otway and Lee,
again, the lyrical fountain is very dry; sadly to
seek is it in Otway, for in him there is no relief,
no pause from the war and clamour of passion.
He has abundant tenderness indeed, far more than
Dryden; but then that tenderness is always
shown stretched on the rack of disappointment,
or suffering. In such high-strung tragedy of
classical form, we much need the chorus of Greek
poetry, or the sweet lyrical ripple of Elizabethan
song. Racine's exquisite instinct for noble style
fills effectually the intervals between extreme
crises. The comic scenes in Otway, therefore,
though unfortunately gross and repulsive, are
absolutely needed for relaxation of the tense
strain. For he makes the impression of being
almost all supreme crisis and desperate situation,
like terrific peaks where the earth-cloud hangs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
in gloom, only soothed by the low warble of
water among mosses, or casual song of little
bird, only broken by flashes of livid lightning&mdash;and
all the rest barren steep; whereas in
Shakespeare the awful snow-summits are girdled
and invested with leafy forest, undulating lawn,
lovely lake.</p>

<p>In Otway development of character, moreover,
is little found; indeed, if "the unities" be observed
as much as possible, that is not easy to compass;
yet for knowledge of character in its labyrinthine
recesses, and unexpected, though intelligible
developments under the moulding pressure of circumstance,
or commerce with other natures, as for
nervous and appropriate poetic diction, Dryden's
<i>Don Sebastian</i> is one of our most remarkable
tragedies. The scene between Dorax and
Sebastian is unsurpassed in Shakespeare. It
presents a credible, though marvellous transformation
of a proud, injured, embittered man
to love and loyalty. Every word tells, every
word is right. Here in one wonderful epitome
we have conversion in the line of vital growth.
It is no mere incredible and arbitrary dislocation
of character, as of some puppet manipulated
by a conjurer, which so often arouses our
surprise in the pre-rebellion drama&mdash;for instance,
in Massinger's <i>Duke of Milan</i>, and (dare I add?)
in the <i>Richard III.</i> of Shakespeare. <i>All for Love</i>,
again, is a splendid picture of the absorbing and
enervating power of one great sensual passion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
while the interview between Ventidius and Antony
rivals that between Dorax and Sebastian.</p>

<p>Lee is an inferior Otway, but a man of true
dramatic genius, with flashes of real poetry. His
<i>Rival Queens</i> is one of our excellent tragedies.
Southerne has produced at least one genuinely
affecting act in his well-constructed drama, <i>The</i>
<i>Fatal Marriage</i>, akin to Otway, though distinctly
inferior. Crowne too was a poet, as is evident
from <i>Thyestes</i>, in spite of repulsiveness and
rant. <i>Thyestes</i> seems to me finer than the
<i>&OElig;dipus</i> of Dryden and Lee, which indeed appears
to have been written to show how much worse a
play than that of Sophocles could be written on the
same tremendous theme. But the <i>Fair Penitent</i>
and <i>Mourning Bride</i>, tragedies by Rowe and
Congreve, are surely merely creditable academic
exercises, destitute of fire and inspiration. In
a lighter vein, Otway could only write some
bustling, occasionally funny, dirty, rollicking
farces. To call them <i>comedies</i> would be to insult
the shades of Shakespeare, Jonson, Fletcher,
Congreve, and Sheridan.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, while there is less inexhaustible
prodigality, and force of unfettered
genius in the Restoration than in the Elizabethan
drama, we have still left dramatic energy of high
enduring quality, which became, however, nearly
extinct in the reigns immediately succeeding.
Under Charles, what was good in the romantic
movement was still retained; the shifting, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>many-coloured
sheen of vigorous life is yet there, the
sun-and-shadow chequer of grave and gay; but
classic exemplars have moderated, and moulded
the work to finer, more regular form. There is
less of exceptional extravagance in the story, less
of inconceivable and sudden metamorphosis or
distortion in the characters, the unpleasant and
bewildering effect in earlier plays being almost as
when an acrobat proceeds to walk with long,
lithe, serpentine body round his own head; less
also of the over-elaborated, misplaced, unveracious
ingenuity of so-called poetic diction. One may
generously attribute all this to the extravagance
of national and literary youth, but the drama of
Spain and Italy ought possibly to bear some of
the responsibility. At any rate, these are grave
defects.</p>

<p>I will illustrate what I mean. It is surely with
a shudder of incredulous aversion that we find
an apparently kind and cordial king, in Fletcher's
<i>Maid's Tragedy</i>, insisting upon a pure-hearted,
generous, young courtier, Amintor, who adored
him with superstitious reverence, breaking off his
engagement to Aspatia, a noble maiden, and
marrying the king's mistress, Evadne, in order
the better to conceal, and carry on with more
security his own guilty intrigue with her, and
father his own bastards upon this loyal friend.
Our incredulous aversion is, if possible, intensified
when Amintor assents to his own dishonour,
because it is the king who has compassed it. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
all the poetry put into the mouth of "lost
Aspatia," nor all the knowledge of human nature
displayed by the poet in the seeming inconsistency
of this evil woman's mongrel repentance at the
bidding of her brother, and conversion from cruel
looseness to equally cruel respectability, and base
desire to vindicate her own damaged reputation
even by the treacherous murder of her royal lover,
can condone for this initial, radical vice of unnatural
motive. No lovely tropes and phrases, nor
harmonies of verbal measure may condone this.
It is with equally incredulous aversion that we find
Massinger's <i>Duke of Milan</i> bidding his creature
Francisco kill the Duchess, who is devoted to him,
and to whom he is devoted, should she happen
to survive him&mdash;which, as Hazlitt says, seems a
start of frenzy rather than a dictate of passion&mdash;then
veering idiotically from love to murderous
hatred upon the mere assertion of this same
creature, Francisco, that his long proved and virtuous
wife has solicited him, Francisco, dishonourably,
he in fact having solicited her unsuccessfully.
With some difficulty we accept the mercurial and
hotheaded gullibility of Othello, played upon by
so cunning a devil as Iago; but we revolt from so
poor and pinchbeck a copy as this.</p>

<p>The early drama, in its poetic beauty of individual
passages, and frequent verisimilitude in
the working out of given motives, now and
again reminds me of the character attributed to
madmen, that they are persons who reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
logically, but on absurd or mistaken premises. And
surely Hazlitt, not Lamb, is right about that
celebrated scene in Ford's <i>Broken Heart</i>, where
Calantha dances on, apparently indifferent, while
messengers come successively to tell her of misfortune
upon misfortune, death upon death; then,
when the revel is over, dies suddenly from
pent-up emotion. "This appears to me to be
tragedy in masquerade, the true false gallop of
sentiment; anything more artificial or mechanical
I cannot conceive." That a woman should thus
silence the voice of humanity, not from necessity,
or for some great purpose, but out of regard to
mere outward decorum of behaviour, for the mere
effect and <i>&eacute;clat</i> of the thing, is not fortitude but
affectation. It often seems as if the Elizabethan
and Caroline poets wrote their plays for the sake
of working up to some striking and effective
situation, and as if it were of little consequence
to them how difficult or impossible the way that
led thither might be, so long as they could hew
their path there. Even the splendid scenes in
Cyril Tourneur's <i>Revenger's Tragedy</i>, where the
brothers assume a disguise in order to tempt their
sister to unchastity, and procure their mother's
consent to it, then threaten to kill their mother
for consenting, appear to be open to the same
objection.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>
<p>But I wish to emphasize the fact that the
drama of Otway, whatever its shortcomings, is,
in this respect of sobriety and truth to nature,
superior on the whole to that of his illustrious
forerunners. And surely a good deal of cant is
now uttered about the academic insipidity and
coldness of Corneille and Racine, who influenced
our later drama, and who powerfully moved the
men of their own day. What can be nobler than
<i>Athalie</i>, <i>Britannicus</i>, or <i>The Cid</i>? Academic coldness
is hardly the phrase that rises to one's lips
when one is watching Sarah Bernhardt in <i>Ph&egrave;dre</i>;
while no comedy is superior to Moli&egrave;re's. If these
men moved in golden fetters, they were strong
enough to wear them as ornaments, rather than
sink under them as impediments. Under the kid
glove you feel the iron thews.</p>

<p>None of this incredulous aversion of which I
spoke do we feel in reading Otway's <i>Venice</i>
<i>Preserved</i>. Dryden averred that he could not
move the feelings as could Otway, who, while
inferior in reflection, poetic expression, and versification,
was a greater master of pathos and
passion. On the latter acts of <i>Venice Preserved</i>
we are hurried breathlessly, as by the impetus of
a mighty wave, shaken to the very depths&mdash;yet
not, I think, unendurably, as by the hideous and
gratuitous cruelty of Ferdinand exercised upon a
little-offending sister in Webster's <i>Duchess of</i>
<i>Malfi</i>, where horror upon horror is accumulated
upon her head, to thrill and harrow us; and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
powerful is the poet that only those can experience
the pleasure which art should extract from
pain, who enjoy the sight of an execution, or sniff
gladly in a torture-chamber the fumes of spilt
blood. We begin to breathe freely only when the
monster, having filled up the measure of his unnatural
malice, utters the fine line that first
shows a faint relenting toward humanity:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cover her face: mine eyes dazzle: she died young.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Elizabethans were superior to their successors
in isolated passages, and for the most
part incomparably so in their lyrics. Therefore,
they are well represented in the "Dramatic specimens"
of Charles Lamb. Otway could not be so
represented; his excellence lies in the noble
organic harmony and sanity of his whole creation,
as in its emotional intensity, from which little
can be detached that shall be admirable out of
its own vital relation. I do not say that Dryden
and Otway never attempt to enlist interest illegitimately
in their tragedies by relying upon
strained situations, and abnormal traits of character;
but I believe they do so less than their
predecessors. And I hardly think Mr. Symonds'
excuse for the Elizabethans a valid one, when he
urges that the men and women of that time were
really as inconsistent as the playwrights represent
them. I do not know that we have any
historical instance of just that queer kind of
inconsistency which we find in their pages, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
I admit that not only history, but our own experience
also, furnishes very strange examples of
self-contradiction. Yet one can only say that
the examples of it in the older drama are not, for
the most part, rendered credible and probable
to us. And, so far, therefore, this is not a
drama which can be always and universally
interesting, except in the supreme examples. In
the same way Otway's and Wycherley's indecencies
would hardly (one supposes) interest a
Victorian audience. The intellectual, or ethical,
atmosphere must not be too unfamiliar and alien.</p>

<p>We are not incredulous when Jaffier, the weak,
affectionate, impulsive hero of <i>Venice Preserved</i>,
maddened by the persecution of his adored bride,
Belvidera, on the part of her implacable father,
who is also a senator, suddenly, and without
counting the cost, from motives of revenge and
hope of better fortune, consents to take part in a
conspiracy against the State, persuaded by his
dearest friend, Pierre, a man of sterner and more
homogeneous fibre. Nor are we incredulous
when, realising with his tender heart what
hideous consequences are likely to ensue in the
disturbance of domestic peace, and the slaughter
of so many innocent people, he allows himself,
however reluctantly, to be over-persuaded by
Belvidera, who comprehends that the murder of
her father, with all the other senators, is intended;
or when, thus over-persuaded, he renounces his
purpose, and betrays his fellow-conspirators,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
including even his well-beloved friend, to the
Doge and Senate. We are not incredulous
when we see Jaffier, on his way to the Senate,
walking as in a dream under spell of his adored
Belvidera's more powerful will, and hear him
say in some of the most beautiful lines the poet
wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, lead me forward now, like a tame lamb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sacrifice: thus in his fatal garlands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decked fine, and pleased the wanton skips and plays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trots by the enticing flattering priestess' side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much transported with his little pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgets his dear companions of the plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till by her bound he's on the altar lain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet then he hardly bleats, such pleasure's in the pain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The catastrophe we feel inevitably to follow
from the given elements in their fusion and
entanglement, the cruel injustice of the father,
the weak and foolish impulsiveness of the hero,
together with his ardent affection both to bride
and friend, and the co-existent corruption in the
State, which made that sinister intrigue against
the Republic possible.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with Dr. Garnett that the
interest of Otway's plays arises from the situation
only, not from the characters. It appears to me
that the humanity of the characters is strongly
realised, and that we are made to sympathise
with them profoundly. As to Addison's remark
that the characters are mostly wicked, I hardly
know what to say. The heroines are ideally
good, and the others are neither better nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
worse than average men and women. If Shakespeare
has given us types&mdash;though these are
also individuals&mdash;of ambition, jealousy, revengeful
avarice, unpractical genius, showing us the
natural issues and eventuations of these, Otway
has given us one type, equally individual, of weak,
but absorbing, and passionate affection, showing
us the natural issues of this. As Johnson
says, he "consulted nature in his own breast."</p>

<p>Having then revealed the intended treason,
after extorting an oath from the Senate to spare
the lives of his coadjutors, Jaffier is confronted
with Pierre and the rest. Then follows a tremendous
scene, in which Jaffier almost abjectly
implores Pierre for pardon, and the latter spurns
him as one proved unworthy the friendship of an
honest man, finally striking and hurling Jaffier
from him. The words he uses to his former friend
are worse even than the blow; their venom can
never cease to rankle. The blunt, open and
magnanimous, though reckless and desperate
character of Pierre is finely contrasted with that
of Jaffier, luxuriously feminine in its sensibility.
Jaffier urges that he has at least saved Pierre's
life, to which his old friend makes the terrible
reply:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I scorn it more because preserved by thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Belvidera was delivered by Jaffier, in
pledge of his own good faith, into the hands of
the conspirators, he gave them a dagger, charging
them to despatch her, should he prove traitor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
The Senate, false to their oath, condemned the
rebels to death with torture; indeed the latter
had refused to accept their lives with bondage at
the hands of the Republic. Belvidera tells Jaffier
this, and then he feels tempted to slay with that
dagger her who has incited him to compass the
ruin of his beloved friend. This is another tremendous
scene. Prevented by the returning and
overwhelming tide of love from executing his
purpose, Jaffier bids her go to her father, and
from him as senator beg the life of Pierre. She
does so, and the old man, relenting at the sight
of his yet beloved child kneeling in agony before
him, grants her prayer. This part also is very
beautiful. But his attempt to save Pierre comes
too late. In their final most moving interview
Jaffier tells Belvidera that he will not survive his
friend. He commends his beloved to Heaven,
calling down every blessing upon her. But when
she understands that they are to part for ever she
exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! call back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your cruel blessing; stay with me and curse me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">* * * Leave thy dagger with me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bequeath me something&mdash;Not one kiss at parting? * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another, sure another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that poor little one you've taken care of;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll give it him truly.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then her mind gives way, and in the fearful
soliloquy that follows, Otway reminds us of the
power shown by Shakespeare in dealing with
minds unhinged. Jaffier being allowed to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
leave of Pierre on the scaffold, Pierre forgives
him, but requests, as a last favour, that his
friend will save him from the dishonour of public
torture by killing him at the last moment. Jaffier
promises, and does so, stabbing himself immediately
after. In the last scene, Belvidera enters
distracted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, come, come, come, nay come to bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pr'ythee my love! The winds! Hark how they whistle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rain beats; oh! how the weather shrinks me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You're angry now; who cares? * * * <span class="directline">[<span class="smcap">Jaffier's</span> <i>ghost rises</i>.<br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Are you returned? See, father, here he's come again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Am I to blame to love him? Oh, the dear one!        <span class="directline">[<i>Ghost sinks.</i><br /></span></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you fly me? Are you angry still then?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, where art thou? Father, why do you do thus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand off. Don't hide him from me. He's here somewhere.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The apparitions of Jaffier and Pierre rise again
bleeding. When they sink, she vows passionately
that she will dig for them till she find them; and,
imagining that they are drawing her downward,
she dies.</p>

<p>Though nearly all authorities have objected
vehemently to the gross quasi-comic scenes with
which Otway has lightened the intense gloom of
his tragedy, I am not sure that the illustrious
French critic, Taine, is not right in his approval
of them. However ghastly, they give some relief.
Though coarse and disgusting, they do stand out
distinctly in the memory. The conspirators met
at the house of one Aquilina, a Greek courtesan,
who had private motives for favouring their
cause. The old senator, Antonio (intended for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
caricature of the debauched Shaftesbury), had
robbed Pierre of this mistress, which was one of
his main incentives to plotting against the State.
Taine's comment on the picture is striking:
"Comme l'homme est prompt &agrave; s'avilir, quand,
&eacute;chapp&eacute; de son r&ocirc;le, il revient &agrave; lui-m&ecirc;me!"
He thinks that Otway alone in that epoch
reproduced the tragedy of Shakespeare: "Il
ne lui manque que de na&icirc;tre cent ans plus
t&ocirc;t." Perhaps; only his form might then have
suffered.</p>

<p>And now as to Otway's diction. There is
nothing convulsive about it; in him, to borrow a
simile from Lowell, "every word does not seem
to be underlined, like those of a school girl's letter."
In the eyes of those to whom expression is good
in proportion as it foregoes its function of expressing,
in favour of a bedizenment, as of some window so
prettily daubed that it lets in no light, the diction
of Dryden, Otway, Goldsmith, Byron may appear
poor. Otway speaks the language of nature and
passion. Still, I admit that Otway's diction
often does want distinction, and his metre rhythmical
quality. He has not always the right
word ready. But his language has certainly the
merit of doing more justice to his subject than
that of his euphuistic predecessors. Take, for
instance, an example from that portion of the fine
play, entitled <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, on good
grounds attributed to Shakespeare. A queen,
the body of whose slain lord remains unburied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
order of a cruel king, implores redress from one
able to grant it in these terms:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, my petition was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set down in ice, which by hot grief uncandied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melts into drops * * * he that will fish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my least minnow, let him lead his line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch one at my heart.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another queen, making a similar request, assures
Theseus that they are&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rinsing our holy begging in our eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make petition clear.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Can these ladies, whose sorrow must have been
much mitigated by their successful invention of
such "precious" hyperboles, stand in need of much
commiseration from us? Otway's expression at
its best is simple, germane to the situation,
vigorous, pregnant with the speaker's emotion,
and therefore well calculated to impregnate us
with it.</p>

<p>In the swift impetuous parts of a play such a
diction is certainly best. Only Heywood, so far
as I know, among the older dramatists, is equally
pure. But I admit that where the action pauses,
where it demands reflective soliloquy, Otway and
Lee are inferior to their great predecessors. In
<i>Venice Preserved</i>, and <i>The Orphan</i>, the pace is so
tremendous, however, that we have hardly leisure
to perceive their poverty in that respect. But there
are occasions, in <i>Don Carlos</i> especially, where we
do feel this inferiority, although the play is one of
Otway's finest. Thus, at the beginning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
fifth act, when the king soliloquises on his
misery in having lost the love of his bride, there
was scope and verge for poetry of reflection, which
Beaumont and Fletcher would have given, as well
as Shakespeare. Dryden also would have given
it, though perhaps of a somewhat coarser grain.
This passage in Otway is poor, unworthy the
occasion. His versification, moreover, though
very good sometimes, is inferior on the whole to
that of Dryden. Yet there are some passages
of true reflective poetry in Otway, though certainly
few and far between. In Southerne they
are almost entirely wanting.</p>

<p>In <i>Don Carlos</i> we note the same want of political
and historic sense which we had also to note in
<i>Venice Preserved</i>, especially when we compare
both plays with the narratives of Saint-R&eacute;al, from
which they are taken, and which have high merit;
or when we compare Otway's with Schiller's
<i>Don Carlos</i>, and even with Alfieri's tragedy,
<i>Filippo</i>, though the extraordinary concentration of
the latter admits of little historic detail. Still
Alfieri's Philip is as life-like and graphic a study
of individuality as that of Saint-R&eacute;al, or Schiller;
whereas the Philip of Otway makes no pretence
to being other than a mere conventional stage-tyrant,
violent, and ever in extremes; yet is he
a man capable of much tenderness also; for he
actually loves the Queen and his son, feelings of
which the real Philip was incapable. Philip's
jealousy in real life, as in the other two plays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
only arises from a fierce sensual greed of personal
possession, and from wounded pride. In Otway
the king repents, although too late, and becomes
reconciled to his wife and son, when he discovers
that his jealousy has made him a blind tool in the
hands of the enemies of Carlos and the Queen,
and that they have not sinned in act. But the
real Philip could not have repented. He did not
believe them guilty in act. Otway's range is
limited, his types are few. He could not draw a
cold deliberate villain. As for his politics, they
are simply those of an ordinary country clergyman's
son. But he died very young, with
little experience. The Philip of Schiller and
Alfieri is a cold, cruel, ambitious bigot, only
capable of simulating natural affection. But in
each of the three tragedies the Queen and Don
Carlos are powerfully presented. The German
play has all the Elizabethan lack of unity.
Schiller's own intense and catholic sympathy with
human progress and popular aspirations dominates
throughout; and while unity of motive&mdash;for instance,
in the important place given to Posa, friend
of Carlos, a magnificent humane ideal&mdash;is somewhat
lacking, there is more human verisimilitude
in his play than in that of Otway, because men
and women are usually swayed by complex and
manifold impulses. The political part taken by the
Queen and Prince in favour of the Flemish rebels
had indeed a great deal to do with the King's
anger against them. The splendid interview<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
of Posa with the tyrant, and also the Grand
Inquisitor's are quite beyond Otway. Philip
had wickedly married Elisabeth, who was
originally betrothed to his son Carlos, and
the conflict of conjugal duty with love is
admirably rendered in all the tragedies, although
the passion and pathos are perhaps warmest
in Otway. This is the sole motive in the
English and Italian plays. In Schiller there
is a whole era, "the very form and pressure" of
a time.</p>

<p>We get as little philosophy or theology, as
political and historic sympathy from Otway.
In this respect he is inferior not only to
Shakespeare, but to Dryden, who is able to
afford more food for the intellect, if less
for the heart. The terse and nervous expression
of ripe and mellow life-wisdom in Dryden's
<i>Spanish Friar</i>, for instance, is very remarkable.
The greater poets indeed are usually men
of great general intellectual power. Chaucer,
Shakespeare, Spenser, Goethe, Dante, Milton,
Byron, Coleridge, Browning, occur at once
to memory. Otway is perhaps exceptional in
this respect. Possibly the free-thinking sentiments
so fiercely hurled in the teeth of the
priest by Pierre on the scaffold afford a clue to
Otway's own attitude toward religion. In <i>The</i>
<i>Orphan</i> we find the same ardour of friendship and
attachment between the sexes, the same raging
despair and revolted denial, when those fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
affections are disappointed&mdash;no faith. Castalio's
last words are&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Patience! preach it to the winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To roaring seas, or raging fires; the knaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That teach it laugh at ye when ye believe them. * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now all I beg is, lay me in one grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus with my love! Farewell, I now am&mdash;nothing.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Chamfort's, the last in the play:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis thus that Heaven its empire does maintain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may afflict, but man must not complain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The scenes in <i>Don Carlos</i>, where Carlos and the
Queen meet, are admirably right in their abrupt,
interrupted utterance, and must have been most
effective on the stage. On the whole, no better
opportunity exists for comparing the classical and
romantic manners than in the examples afforded
by these three plays on the reign of Philip. Don
John's soliloquy about bastardy and free love is
exceptionally good as a purple patch of poetry in
Otway, though not without a reminiscence of
Shakespeare's Edmund. There are likewise two
splendid lines uttered by the King when Gomez is
tempting him to suspect his son and queen.
Gomez says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis true they gazed, but 'twas not very long.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>King.</i> Lie still, my heart. Not long was't that you said?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Gomez.</i> No longer than they in your presence stayed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>King.</i> <i>No longer? Why a soul in less time flies</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To Heaven, and they have changed theirs at their eyes.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The Orphan</i> I do not myself like so much as
<i>Don Carlos</i>, but it is full of Otway's peculiar
power, and has a greater reputation. The plot
is repulsive, with a flavour of Elizabethan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
unsoundness. All the mischief and misery arise
from a want of moral courage shown by Castalio,
the passionate, but weak and irresolute hero, in
concealing&mdash;partly from a kind of dastardly, rakish,
bravado, and partly from fear of his father's
disapproval, as well as a certain misplaced deference
to fraternal affection&mdash;his own ardent and
honourable affection for the orphan girl to whom
he is secretly married. The character of Castalio
is similar to that of Jaffier, Carlos, and of Otway
himself, judging from what we know of his relations
with Mrs. Barry. Monimia is another
Belvidera, though less powerfully conceived.
They are exquisite types of womanhood, own
sisters to Cordelia, Imogen, Desdemona. There
is no local colour in the play, but we miss that in
<i>Don Carlos</i> and <i>Venice Preserved</i> more particularly.
Otway's scenes might be in abstract space. The
poetry of the period of Charles II., William, and
Anne, was singularly blind to the face of external
nature, a very serious defect; not even Greek or
Latin poetry was thus blind.</p>

<p>I have drawn a distinction between two kinds
of poetry in drama&mdash;that of movement or crisis,
and that of repose or contemplation. The poetry
appropriate to the one condition must necessarily
be different from that appropriate to the other,
and he is so far a bad poet who confounds the
species. It will be the second kind that can be
transplanted to books of beautiful extracts, and
lends itself to quotation, because that is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
germane to many similar circumstances; whereas
the former belongs especially to the particular
event or crisis. In the former species I have
allowed that Otway is not rich. We look in vain
for the poetry of Hamlet, of brooding, irresolute,
melancholy; for the poetry of Lorenzo, that of
music; or Portia, which is that of mercy; for any
lovely words like those of Perdita, the very breath
and symphony of flowers; for any accents like those
of heart-stricken Aspatia, in her swan-song of
desertion; or visionary anthem of Helen's ideal
beauty, as in Marlowe. No Claudio out of
Shakespeare has uttered a final word concerning
physical death equal to this: "To lie in cold obstruction,
and to rot"; no C&aelig;sar has fixed for us
the visible tokens of a born conspirator; no Jaques
summed for us the seasons of human life. Nor
are these mere "purple patches"; far from it, they
are of the seamless garment's very warp and woof.</p>

<p>But, if we consider, we shall find that much of
the poetry we love best in that earlier drama is the
poetry of movement or supreme event; and this
we do find in Otway, as the passages which I have
already quoted, or mentioned, are sufficient to
prove. We do find in him poetry parallel to that
of mad Lear's heart-quaking utterance in presence
of Cordelia, which commences&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pray do not mock me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a very foolish fond old man,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and ends&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Do not laugh at me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as I am a man, I think this lady<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be my child Cordelia.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span></p>
<p>or to her answer&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so I am, I am!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She has some cause to be angry with him, but her
sisters none, he says; and she answers "No
cause! no cause!" That, which is, perhaps, the
finest passage in all literature, has not one metaphor,
one trope, one "precious" phrase; but any
old injured madman might speak just so. When
poor, laughable, dissolute old Falstaff, dying,
"babbles o' green fields"; when Lear at the last
apostrophises his dead Cordelia&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou'lt come no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never, never, never, never, never! * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray you, undo this button. Thank you, sir! * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you see this? Look on her&mdash;look&mdash;her lips&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we can hardly bear to hear them. It is so much
finer, because so much truer to nature than when
those ingeniously poetical ladies, entreating the
sepulture of their best beloved, urge that they are
"rinsing their holy begging in their eyes." But
Tourneur's Castiza takes our breath away
when she adjures the trusted and reverenced
mother, who has suffered her own better nature to
be warped and darkened, and invites her daughter
to suffer moral degradation, in the words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mother, come from that poisonous woman there!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is a gleam of heavenly light blinding us out of
the gloom. And when the Duchess of Malfi in her
last struggle entreats&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I pray thee look thou givest my little boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some syrup for his cold; and let the girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say her prayers ere she sleep. Now what you please<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span></p>
<p>we are reminded of the equally touching words of
Belvidera about her child, and the last words of
dying Monimia:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I am laid low in the grave, and quite forgotten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May'st thou be happy in a fairer bride!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But none can ever love thee like Monimia. * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm here; who calls me? Methought I heard a voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet as the shepherd's pipe upon the mountains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all his little flock's at feed before him * * *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How my head swims. 'Tis very dark. Good night.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is true that the poet, since he takes the liberty to
translate into verse men's ordinary language, may
also interpret and mould his story, together with
the speech it may involve, artistically, according
to his own genius. But then the turn of thought,
of feeling and of phraseology must have verisimilitude,
that is to say, must seem related, not
only to the event as it might appear to the poet
personally, but as it ought to appear to him when
he has imagined himself into the character and
circumstances represented. Thus the strange
figure made use of by Jaffier in addressing Pierre,
who is about to be tortured on the rack, is felt to
be absolutely fitting. For anger, despair, remorse,
will sometimes burst forth in hyperbole. Wisdom
is justified of her children.</p>

<p>And now perhaps we may hardly be surprised
to hear the consenting voice of great authorities
place Otway very high among the masters of
English tragedy. Dryden, though, when "fearing
a rival near the throne," he had called Otway "a
barren illiterate man," said afterwards: "The
motions which are studied are never so natural as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
those which break out in the height of a real passion.
Mr. Otway possessed this part as thoroughly
as any of the ancients or moderns." And again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Charming his face and charming was his verse.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Addison says: "Otway has followed nature in the
language of his tragedy, and therefore shines in
the passionate parts more than any of our English
poets." Goldsmith again: "The English language
owes very little to Otway, though next to Shakespeare
the greatest genius England has ever produced
in tragedy." Then let us remember the
beautiful lines of Collins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But wherefore need I wander wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To old Ilissus' distant side,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Deserted stream and mute!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild Arun too has heard thy strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And echo 'midst my native plains<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Been soothed by Pity's lute.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There first the wren thy myrtles shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On gentlest Otway's infant head,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To him thy cell was shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while he sung the female heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With youth's soft notes unspoiled by art,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thy turtles mixed their own.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Coleridge, musing upon "mighty poets in
their misery dead," in his "Monody on the death
of Chatterton" sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is this the land of song-ennobled line?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is this the land where genius ne'er in vain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ah me, yet Spenser, gentlest bard divine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His weary limbs in lonely anguish laid,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Pity, hopeless, hung her head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While 'mid the pelting of that merciless storm<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span></p>
<p>Respecting Otway's scenes of passionate affection,
Sir Walter Scott says that they "rival and sometimes
excel those of Shakespeare; more tears have
been shed probably for the sorrows of Belvidera and
Monimia than for those of Juliet and Desdemona."</p>

<p>Thomas Otway<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was born March 3rd, 1651, at
Trotton near Midhurst in Sussex, and was the only
son of the Rev. Humphrey Otway, Rector of
Wolbeding in the same county. He was educated
at Wickeham School, Winchester, and at eighteen
was entered a commoner of Christ Church College,
Oxford, early in 1669. He does not display much
learning, and probably did not study very hard,
but preferred amusing himself with his friends,
among whom was young Lord Falkland. He had
been intended for the Church; but the death of
his father, who, as he tells us, "left him no other
patrimony than his faith and loyalty," probably
obliged him to leave Oxford without taking a
degree. In 1671 he went to London to seek his
fortune there. At the theatre in Dorset Garden,
Salisbury Court, all Otway's plays, except the last,
were performed by the Duke of York's company;
and here Otway himself made his first and only
appearance as an actor, taking the part of the King
in Mrs. Behn's <i>Forced Marriage</i>. This attempt was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>eminently unsuccessful. He seems now to have
cultivated the society of men of rank and fashion,
who tolerated him as a boon companion for the sake
of his agreeable social qualities, but who, while they
helped him to get rid of his money in many foolish
ways, left him in the lurch when he needed them
most. The young Earl of Plymouth, however, a
natural son of the king, and a college friend,
did befriend him. His premature death at
Tangier, aged twenty-two, was a serious loss to
Otway.</p>

<p>The dramatist's earliest play was <i>Alcibiades</i>, first
printed in 1675. It is a poor production, though
there are scenes in it of distinct promise. <i>Don</i>
<i>Carlos</i> appeared in the year after, and won extraordinary
favour, partly owing to the patronage
of Rochester, who dropped an author as soon as
he acquired, by merit or popularity, some independent
standing, fancying that his own literary
dictatorship might be thereby imperilled. Thus
he had dropped Dryden, taken up Elkanah Settle,
the "City poet," dropped him, and elevated
Crowne. But Crowne's <i>Calisto</i> becoming too
popular for the malignant wit, he transferred
his patronage to Otway. In 1677 Otway produced
two translations from the French, <i>Titus</i>
<i>and Berenice</i>, from Racine, and <i>The Cheats of</i>
<i>Scapin</i>, from Moli&egrave;re. All these were rhyming,
so-called "heroic" plays, our playwrights herein
following the French example. But Dryden, in
the Prologue to <i>Aurungzebe</i>, having announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
that he would henceforth abandon the use of
rhyme in tragedy, other writers soon followed
his lead. The success of <i>Don Carlos</i> was the
occasion of a coolness between Otway and Dryden,
who, with the proverbial amiability of literary
rivals, said some sharp things about one another;
but we have seen how generously Dryden afterwards
gave Otway his due meed of praise. To
this period, says Thornton, we may probably
assign a duel between Otway and Settle ("Doeg"),
in which Settle is said to have misbehaved.</p>

<p>With the fine actress, Mrs. Barry, a daughter
of Colonel Barry, who had sacrificed his fortune
in the service of Charles I., Otway fell desperately
in love. She had taken a part in his <i>Alcibiades</i>,
and became famous by her representations of
Belvidera and Monimia. To this affection, with
all the depth of his character, Otway remained
constant; but Mrs. Barry did not return it; at
any rate, she deemed the attractions of Lord
Rochester superior. Possibly Mr. Gosse may be
right in thinking that she was a cold and calculating
woman, who would reject a penniless lover,
yet keep him dangling attendance upon her if he
wrote parts that suited her as an actress. In this
case, however, it seems odd that such parts should
have suited her; and it would be touching to note
how Otway must have idealized his lady in writing
them for her. But she may honestly have preferred
the witty and 5 peer to the tragic
and penniless poet&mdash;though Otway was a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>looking
man with very fine eyes, and Rochester,
according to Otway (a prejudiced witness), looked
like an owl. Yet, judging by Rochester's portraits,
he was distinguished, though rather feminine in
appearance. However, Rochester was as sincerely
attached to Mrs. Barry as such a rake could be,
and she really owed him much, for he personally
educated her in the duties of her profession.
Otway loved "not wisely, but too well," as we
know from the remarkable love letters, reprinted
in the appendix to the present volume. With
characteristic hotheadedness and weakness combined
he could not resolve to renounce her, even
though he knew she was Rochester's mistress.
Hence the insolent bitterness of Rochester's attack
upon him in his "Session of the Poets," in which
he alludes to Otway's pitiable condition on his
return from Flanders.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> For even Otway's human
nature had to yield at last, and he could no longer
bear to hang about the Duke's Theatre, as had
been his wont, in order to get a glimpse of his
lady. He therefore obtained from the Earl of
Plymouth a cornet's commission in a new regiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>of horse, which was sent out at this time (1678) to
join the army under Monmouth in Flanders&mdash;not,
surely, as Mr. Gosse says, in the service of France,
but, on the contrary, to relieve Mons in the Dutch
interest. Very shortly after, however, the troops
were disbanded and recalled, while the money
voted by the Commons for their payment was
shamefully misappropriated, they being paid only
by debentures, the credit of which was so low that
they were hardly saleable. This is why the poet
came home in so miserable a plight, and not on
account of any want of courage.</p>

<p>It was like Rochester to reproach him on this
score&mdash;the man who showed the white feather to
Lord Mulgrave, and made lackeys cudgel Dryden
in Rose Alley. But Otway gave him as good as
he got in the "Poet's Complaint." The matter
is explained in the Epilogue to <i>Caius Marius</i>,
which he produced in 1680, having written most
of it in camp abroad. It is a barefaced, and indeed
avowed plagiarism from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, though
one or two scenes are his own, and have some
merit. Marius, at all events, was a rather more
dignified representative of Shaftesbury than old
Antonio in <i>Venice Preserved</i>. This play occupied
the place of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> on our stage for
seventy years. With a more avowed party motive
he likewise published in the same year "The Poet's
Complaint of his Muse." When we think of
"Absalom and Achitophel," the contrast is woeful
indeed. All Otway's poems are bad, except the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
Epistle to Duke, his friend. The blunted insipidity
of his conventional diction is worthy of
Pope's followers. Before leaving England he had
written his first comedy, <i>Friendship in Fashion</i>,
which appeared in 1678.</p>

<p>In the year 1680 Otway's second great play,
<i>The Orphan</i>, appeared. Voltaire attacked it
furiously, and will allow no merit to <i>le tendre</i>
<i>Otway</i>. Tenderness anywhere was not likely to
find favour with the <i>tigre-singe</i>, whose fascinating
wit was of an icy brilliance. But Jeremy Collier
also attacked the play on other grounds, in his
"Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness
of the English Stage." Mrs. Barry has recorded
that in the character of Monimia she could never
pronounce the words "Poor Castalio!" without
tears. May she not have been thinking of another
Castalio? Let us believe it! Ah! if only Mrs.
Barry had been the Belvidera of her poet's dream,
she might have saved him from his evil genius,
from his selfish patrons, and from himself.</p>

<p>In 1681 Otway produced <i>The Soldier's Fortune</i>,
a comedy which contains allusions to his own
adventures abroad, and is the only contemporary
play not dedicated to a person of quality, being
dedicated to Bentley, the publisher. Depressed
by his hopeless passion, "alternately elevated
with promises and dejected by scorn and neglect,
caressed for his wit, despised for his poverty, and
exposed to all those attendant ills, which a
generous spirit feels more acutely than actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
privation, neglect, wrongs real and imaginary, the
altered eye of friends," we can hardly wonder at
the gloomy tone which he assumed in the Epilogue
to this play. Can we not picture him with
those large, limpid, wistful eyes looking for the
face he most wanted among the crowds, preoccupied
or listless, that passed in the gathering
twilight of that afternoon, which he mentions in
the last of those letters to Mrs. Barry, lingering
among strange faces of promenaders under the
trees of the gay Mall, looking long for her
who never came, never fulfilled her promise to
meet him? This seems to have been the turning
point in Otway's career. Failing in this last
attempt to win his lady's love, and sinking under
accumulated debt, he, like how many others,
surrendered himself to those habits of inebriety,
which insidiously promised him consolation. And
yet his creative powers were maturing daily, for
his greatest work, <i>Venice Preserved</i>, was brought
upon the stage in 1682.</p>

<p>Since Otway's plays were well received, it may
seem strange that he should have remained so
poor. But, in the first place, he was evidently
one of those generous, reckless good fellows like
"Goldy," and Sheridan, who spend all they have,
and more too. And, in the second place, the
profits of the playhouse were very small.
Theatrical amusements were not the general
resort of the people&mdash;a serious disadvantage, as
Scott observes, to the art, as well as to the purse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
of the playwright. Religious scruples still withheld
many, as in Commonwealth days; and
others were kept away by the indecency then in
vogue. The most popular play did not remain
long on the boards. In Otway's time, moreover,
an author had only one benefit from the representation,
which was on the third night. Southerne
was the first to have two benefits, and it was not
until 1729 that the profits of three representations
became the right of the author. Gildon says
that Otway got a hundred pounds a piece for <i>The</i>
<i>Orphan</i> and <i>Venice Preserved</i>, while old Jacob
Tonson bought the copyright of <i>Venice Preserved</i>
for fifteen pounds. The poet was sometimes in
such straits that he had to pawn his third day for
fifty pounds. He could not have made much by
his few prologues and occasional poems.</p>

<p>Otway's last play was a comedy called <i>The</i>
<i>Atheist</i>, a continuation of <i>The Soldier's Fortune</i>,
represented in 1683, or the following year, at the
Theatre Royal by the united companies, who had
amalgamated in 1682, and removed to Drury Lane.
Charles II. died in February, 1685, and Otway
thereupon published a poem called "Windsor
Castle," in which he praised the late king, and
exulted over the accession of James. His praises
of Charles were probably not much more sincere
than those which he, and other writers of the day,
lavished upon people of rank in their dedications
for the sake of a few guineas. More guineas are
to be had now-a-days by flattering the whims and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
tastes of that "many-headed" monarch, under
whose reign we have the honour to live. In the
so-called Augustan age, literary merit was systematically
neglected. Witness Butler and Cowley.
Yet Otway was the son of a loyalist, and ever
faithful to the Court. Nor was Charles incapable
of appreciating talent. But Otway, to use his
own words, only got the "pension of a prince's
praise"; and a gracious command to lampoon
the greatest statesman of the time, which he did
accordingly. Praise of one who cannot be a rival
is an inexpensive form of present. It appears,
however, that two of the royal mistresses were
more generous&mdash;Nell Gwynne and the Duchess
of Portsmouth, whose bounty, "extended to him
in his last extremity," he extols in the dedication
of <i>Venice Preserved</i>.</p>

<p>Otway had withdrawn from the importunate
clamour of creditors to an obscure public-house,
the sign of the Bull, on Tower Hill; and here, on
the 14th of April, 1685, at the premature age of
thirty-four, he died. His body was conveyed thence
to the Church of St. Clement Danes, and there
deposited in a vault. About the circumstances of
his death there is a conflict of evidence. The story
that has gained currency is probably not the true
one; only one early biographer is our authority
for it. He states that, having long been insufficiently
fed, Otway one day sallied forth in a
starving state, and begged a shilling from a
gentleman in a coffee house, saying, "I am the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
poet Otway." This person, surprised and distressed,
gave him a guinea. With it he bought a
roll of bread, and began to devour it with the
rage of hunger; but, incapable of swallowing
from long abstinence, he was choked with the first
mouthful. Other writers make no mention of this
incident, and Wood is not only silent on the
subject, but states that in his "sickness" (implying
gradual decay) he composed a congratulatory
poem on the inauguration of James II. Spence,
moreover, who had the anecdote from Dennis the
critic, tells quite a different story. He relates
that Otway had an intimate friend named
Blakiston, who was murdered in the street, and
that, to revenge the deed, Otway pursued the
assassin on foot as far as Dover, where he was
seized with a fever, occasioned by fatigue, privation,
and excitement. On his return to London, being
heated, he drank water, which was the immediate
occasion of his death. Yet undoubtedly insufficient
nourishment must have accelerated his end.
It is quite possible, therefore, that the anecdote
about the guinea and the roll may be substantially
true, although this circumstance may not have
been the actual cause of death.</p>

<p>The ardour and constancy of Otway's personal
attachments are very notable all through his
career&mdash;witness his friendship with Shadwell
(though Mr. Gosse strangely calls Shadwell his
enemy), with an unknown person whom he
names <i>Senander</i>, and especially with Duke, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
expressions of fondness for him were very warm.
And it now appears that he fell a victim to this
devoted comradeship, which he has so forcibly
delineated in his tragedy. "Whom the gods love
die young." Otway is with Shelley, Keats and
Byron, with Marlowe and with Chatterton.</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p>&#x2042; <span class="smcap">Otway</span> made some translations from Ovid and
Horace. He also wrote prologues to Lee's <i>Constantine</i>
and Mrs. Behn's <i>City Heiress</i>, with an epistle to Creech on
his translation of Lucretius, besides a few miscellaneous
poems, prologues, and epilogues. A translation from the
French, the <i>History of Triumvirates</i>, was published a year
after his decease. Moreover, it was reported that he had
been engaged on an original tragedy at the time of his
death; Betterton, the actor and manager, advertised
for this play, but it was never found. All authorities,
except Mr. Gosse, agree in rejecting as a forgery the play
named <i>Heroic Friendship</i>, which a bookseller long afterwards
(in 1719) attempted to palm off upon the public as the lost
tragedy of Otway. While destitute of all external evidence
for genuineness, it is usually regarded as a contemptible
production, equally destitute of internal evidence. Mr.
Gosse indeed urges a similarity in the principal character
to the heroes of Otway. But of course to produce such a
similarity would be the obvious resort of any forger. It
was printed, though never acted. Gildon relates that
Otway was very fond of punch, and that the last thing he
wrote was a song in praise of it.</p>

<p>William Oldys, in his famous annotated copy of
Langbaine's <i>Dramatic Poets</i>, in the British Museum, thus
writes of Otway: "There is an excellent and beautiful
picture of Mr. Otway, who was a fine, portly, graceful man,
now among the poetical collection of Lord Chesterfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>
(I think it was painted by John Ryley), in a full bottom wig,
and nothing like that quakerish figure which Knapton has
impost upon the world." Interlined is the following:
"He was of middle size, about 5 ft. 7 in., inclinable to
corpulency, had thoughtful, yet lively, and, as it were,
speaking eyes."</p>

<p>I am indebted to Dr. Grosart for the foregoing quotation,
and have to express my thanks to Mr. S. W. Orson
for numerous textual suggestions and emendations.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In Mr. Saintsbury's admirable monograph on Dryden (<i>English</i>
<i>Men of Letters</i>) we have, for the first time, the truth told about
the origins of the so-called "heroic" drama in England&mdash;a semi-operatic
creation of Sir W. Davenant under the Protectorate. But
though the rhyme may have come from France, it seems to me
that for the rant our Restoration playwrights need not have looked
so far as the Scud&eacute;ry romance, or the Spanish poetry; they had
examples nearer home, which is equally true of the "conceits."
Dryden is the father of modern prose, and the father of didactic
verse, even, one may say, of modern satire also. Now, if a man
achieve a reputation for eminence in one department, his eminence
in another, however indisputable, is sure to be disputed. It has
seemed evident to critics (and consequently to bookmakers) that
since he was a critic he could not be a poet. Yet he was certainly
both. He is more than what Matthew Arnold names him,
a "classic of our prose."</p></div>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Besides</span> the writers mentioned in my
Introduction, Campistron, a pupil of
Racine, founded a play called <i>Andronic</i>
on this same history of <i>Don Carlos</i>.
Some Spanish historians, in the interest
of Philip, have tried to blacken the character
of his son. But the Abb&eacute; de San
Real (who has been called the French
Sallust) seems to have estimated him
rightly, while the dramatists have, on the whole, adopted
the Frenchman's conception, which was apparently derived
from reliable Spanish sources. The motto prefixed from
Horace is in allusion to the fact that this play received
the approbation of the King and the Duke of York. It
had a long success at the theatre, and we may agree with
those who called it, as Otway tells us in the preface, the
best "heroic" play of the time&mdash;containing, as it does,
far less of rant and confusion, but more of nature and
passion, than the "heroic" plays of Dryden&mdash;though
<i>Aurungzebe</i> may not be far behind it. Booth, the actor,
was informed by Betterton that <i>Don Carlos</i> continued for
several years to attract larger audiences than <i>The Orphan</i>
or <i>Venice Preserved</i>. It was first represented at the Duke's
Theatre in the year 1676, and was published in the same
year.</p>

<p>Philip II., son of the Emperor Charles V., became King
of Naples and Sicily in 1554 on his father's abdication,
and King Consort of England by his marriage with Mary
two years after he ascended the Spanish throne. In 1557
he gained the victory of St. Quentin, which might have
made him master of France, but he did not follow it up,
being, it is said, so elated and yet terrified that he vowed:
first, never to engage in another fight, and secondly, to
found a monastery in honour of St. Lawrence at Escorial.
Later came the great rebellion of the Low Countries,
which, in spite of Alva's ability, sanguinary cruelty, and
persecutions, resulted in the independence of "the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Provinces," and the triumph of the reformed faith. Philip
subdued Portugal, and sent the huge Spanish Armada to
conquer England, the illustrious heretic Elizabeth having
succeeded to Mary. But the storms and the English
together were too much for him. He showed resignation
and dignity, however, when the admiral in command
announced this misfortune to him. He married Elizabeth
of Valois after Mary's death.</p>

<p>It is probable that Don Carlos inherited the personal
pride and hauteur of his race, and he is said to have
treated Alva with rudeness on a public occasion, only
because the Duke was a little late in paying his respects
to him. Alva, as a noble, had his share of pride, and
being, moreover, malignant, never forgave this.</p>

<p>But the rivalry of these two personages in desiring
the government of the revolted Netherlands is a more
probable cause of the affront, for it seems to have been
just before the Duke proceeded thither as Governor, when
he went to take leave of Carlos, that it occurred. Philip
had refused the post to his son, and given it to Alva.
Carlos is even said by some to have threatened the Duke
with his sword; but, if so, it seems likely that something
in the words or triumphant demeanour of the latter provoked
the hotheaded youth beyond endurance. This
spirited and aspiring Prince was evidently far more liberal
in religion and politics than his father, a disposition likely
to be intensified by the fact that his father persistently
kept him in tutelage, and forbade him all participation in
the management of public affairs, which he so ardently
coveted. That he entered into correspondence with the
gallant men striving for liberty of conscience and nationality
in the Low Countries seems certain. This was a
pretext and motive for his arrest, imprisonment, and
murder. But jealous suspicion that the Queen, promised
and betrothed by Philip himself to his own son, cared too
much for that son, and more than suspicion that Carlos
cared too much for her, afforded a motive yet more
powerful. Elizabeth of France (daughter of Henry II.)
was put to death about the same time, and the Prince
of Orange openly accused Philip of these murders, alleging
that they were committed in order that he might be free
to marry his own niece, Anne of Austria. Carlos is
variously reported to have been killed by poison, strangulation,
or opening his veins in a bath. Philip died in 1598.
His character has been well suggested and outlined in a
recent play, Lord Tennyson's "Queen Mary."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">To His Royal Highness</span> THE DUKE.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h3>

<p>
Sir,</p>

<p>'Tis an approved opinion, there is not so unhappy
a creature in the world as the man that wants
ambition; for certainly he lives to very little use
that only toils in the same round, and because he
knows where he is, though in a dirty road, dares
not venture on a smoother path for fear of
being lost. That I am not the wretch I condemn, your Royal
Highness may be sufficiently convinced, in that I durst presume
to put this poem under your patronage. My motives to it
were not ordinary: for besides my own propensity to take
an opportunity of publishing the extreme devotion I owe your
Royal Highness, the mighty encouragement I received from
your approbation of it when presented on the stage was hint
enough to let me know at whose feet it ought to be laid.
Yet, whilst I do this, I am sensible the curious world will
expect some panegyric on those heroic virtues which are
throughout it so much admired. But, as they are a theme too
great for my undertaking, so only to endeavour at the truth of
them must, in the distance between my obscurity and their height,
savour of a flattery, which in your Royal Highness's esteem I would
not be thought guilty of; though in that part of them which relates
to myself (viz., your favours showered on a thing so mean as I
am) I know not how to be silent. For you were not only so
indulgent as to bestow your praise on this, but even (beyond my
hopes) to declare in favour of my first essay of this nature, and
add yet the encouragement of your commands to go forward,
when I had the honour to kiss your Royal Highness's hand, in
token of your permission to make a dedication to you of the
second. I must confess, and boast I am very proud of it; and it
were enough to make me more, were I not sensible how far I am
undeserving. Yet when I consider you never give your favours
precipitately, but that it is a certain sign of some desert when
you vouchsafe to promote, I, who have terminated my best hopes
in it, should do wrong to your goodness, should I not let the
world know my mind, as well as my condition, is raised by it. I
am certain none that know your Royal Highness will disapprove
my aspiring to the service of so great and so good a master;
one who (as is apparent to all those who have the honour to be
near you and know you by that title) never raised without merit,
or discountenanced without justice. It is that, indeed, obliging
severity which has in all men created an awful love and respect
towards you; since in the firmness of your resolution the brave
and good man is sure of you, whilst the ill-minded and malignant
fears you. This I could not pass over; and I hope your Royal
Highness will pardon it, since it is unaffectedly my zeal to you,
who am in nothing so unfortunate, as that I have not a better
opportunity to let you and the world know how much I am,</p>

<p class="right">Your Royal Highness's<br />
Most humble, most faithful, and most obedient Servant,<br />
THO. OTWAY.</p>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">'Tis</span> not that I have any great affection
to scribbling, that I pester thee with
a preface; for, amongst friends, 'tis
almost as poor a trade with poets, as
it is with those that write hackney
under attorneys; it will hardly keep
us in ale and cheese. Honest Ariosto
began to be sensible of it in his time,
who makes his complaint to this purpose:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I pity those who in these latter days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do write, when bounty hath shut up her gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where day and night in vain good writers knock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for their labour oft have but a mock.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus I find it according to Sir John Harington's translation;
had I understood Italian, I would have given it
thee in the original, but that is not my talent; therefore
to proceed: this Play was the second that ever I writ,
or thought of writing. I must confess, I had often a
titillation to poetry, but never durst venture on my muse,
till I got her into a corner in the country; and then,
like a bashful young lover, when I had her in private, I
had courage to fumble, but never thought she would
have produced anything; till at last, I know not how,
ere I was aware, I found myself father of a dramatic
birth, which I called <i>Alcibiades</i>; but I might, without
offence to any person in the play, as well have called it
<i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>; for my hero, to do him right, was none
of that squeamish gentleman I make him, but would as
little have boggled at the obliging the passion of a young
and beautiful lady as I should myself, had I the same
opportunities which I have given him. This I publish
to antedate the objections some people may make against
that play, who have been (and much good may it do
them!) very severe, as they think, upon this. Whoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
they are, I am sure I never disobliged them: nor have
they (thank my good fortune) much injured me. In the
meanwhile I forgive them, and, since I am out of the
reach on't, leave them to chew the cud on their own
venom. I am well satisfied I had the greatest party of
men of wit and sense on my side; amongst which I can
never enough acknowledge the unspeakable obligations
I received from the Earl of R.,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who, far above what I am
ever able to deserve from him, seemed almost to make it
his business to establish it in the good opinion of the King
and his Royal Highness; from both of whom I have since
received confirmation of their good liking of it, and encouragement
to proceed. And it is to him, I must in all
gratitude confess, I owe the greatest part of my good success
in this, and on whose indulgency I extremely build my hopes
of a next. I dare not presume to take to myself what a
great many, and those (I am sure) of good judgment too,
have been so kind to afford me&mdash;viz., that it is the best
heroic play that has been written of late; for, I thank
Heaven, I am not yet so vain. But this I may modestly
boast of, which the author<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of the French <i>Berenice</i> has
done before me, in his preface to that play, that it never
failed to draw tears from the eyes of the auditors; I mean,
those whose hearts were capable of so noble a pleasure:
for it was not my business to take such as only come to a
playhouse to see farce-fools, and laugh at their own deformed
pictures. Though a certain writer that shall be
nameless<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> (but you shall guess at him by what follows),
being asked his opinion of this play, very gravely cocked,
and cried, "I'gad, he knew not a line in it he would be
author of."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But he is a fine facetious witty person, as my
friend Sir Formal has it; and to be even with him, I know a
comedy of his, that has not so much as a quibble in it that
I would be author of. And so, Reader, I bid him and thee
Farewell.</p>

<span class="i0">Law was an innovation brought in since,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My glorious father got me in his heat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When warlike Belgia felt his conquering power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the proud Germans owned him emperor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should it be a stain then on my blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I came not in the common road,<br /></span>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">"The</span> Orphan" was first represented
in 1680, and printed during the same
year. Thornton, following Langbaine,
states that the play was founded on
the story of Brandon, which he reprints
in his edition of Otway, and
which forms part of a novel entitled
"English Adventures by a Person of Honour," published
in 1676, and said to be by Roger Boyle, Earl of Orrery.
The adventures are supposed to occur to Henry VIII.,
who, when young, is reported to have often wandered
abroad in disguise, like Haroun-Al-Raschid. He is represented
going about with Brandon, a young nobleman, afterwards
married to Henry's sister, widow of Louis XII., and
founder of the Suffolk family. Brandon relates the circumstances
(which are in substance identical with the
story of <i>The Orphan</i>) as having happened to himself,
the main incidents being alleged to be true. A yet earlier
play, <i>The Hog hath lost his Pearl</i>, by Robert Tailor (1612-13),
has very much the same foundation. As to the possibility
of Monimia's deception through the personation of one
twin brother by another, we must remember that this
took place in darkness, and that not a word was spoken,
total silence having been agreed upon when the secret
meeting with Castalio was arranged, on account of the
proximity of Acasto's chamber. Acasto, the guardian of
Monimia, is believed to be a portrait of the first Duke of
Ormond (see Carte's "Life of Ormond").</p>

<p><i>The Orphan</i> was acted at Covent Garden in 1815, and
subsequently at the Bath Theatre in 1819, when Miss
O'Neill performed the part of Monimia. The celebrated
Mrs. Bracegirdle appeared in the character of Cordelio,
Polydore's page, when she was a child about six years old.</p>

<p>
Madam,<br />
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/image139a.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">After</span> having a great while wished to write
something that might be worthy to lay
at your Highness's feet, and finding it
impossible: since the world has been so
kind to me to judge of this poem to my
advantage, as the most pardonable fault
which I have made in its kind, I had
sinned against myself, if I had not chosen this opportunity
to implore (what my ambition is most fond of) your
favour and protection.</p>

<p>For, though Fortune would not so far bless my endeavours
as to encourage them with your Royal Highness's
presence, when this came into the world, yet I cannot but
declare it was my design and hopes it might have been
your divertisement in that happy season when you returned
again to cheer all those eyes that had before wept for your
departure, and enliven all hearts that had drooped for your
absence. When Wit ought to have paid its choicest
tributes in, and Joy have known no limits, then I hoped
my little mite would not have been rejected; though my
ill fortune was too hard for me, and I lost a greater
honour, by your Royal Highness's absence, than all the
applauses of the world besides can make me reparation for.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I thought myself not quite unhappy, so
long as I had hopes this way yet to recompense my disappointment
past; when I considered also that poetry
might claim right to a little share in your favour: for Tasso
and Ariosto, some of the best, have made their names
eternal by transmitting to after-ages the glory of your
ancestors; and under the spreading of that shade, where
two of the best have planted their laurels, how honoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>should I be, who am the worst, if but a branch might
grow for me!</p>

<p>I dare not think of offering anything in this address,
that might look like a panegyric, for fear lest, when I have
done my best, the world should condemn me for saying
too little, and you yourself check me for meddling with a
task unfit for my talent.</p>

<p>For the description of virtues and perfections so rare as
yours are ought to be done by as deliberate, as skilful a
hand; the features must be drawn very fine, to be like;
hasty daubing would but spoil the picture, and make it so
unnatural as must want false lights to set it off: and your
virtue can receive no more lustre from praises than your
beauty can be improved by art; which, as it charms the
bravest Prince that ever amazed the world with his virtue,
so let but all other hearts inquire into themselves, and
then judge how it ought to be praised.</p>

<p>Your love, too, as none but that great hero who has it
could deserve it, and therefore, by a particular lot from
Heaven, was destined to so extraordinary a blessing, so
matchless for itself, and so wondrous for its constancy,
shall be remembered to your immortal honour, when all
other transactions of the age you live in shall be forgotten.</p>

<p>But I forget that I am to ask pardon for the fault I have
been all this while committing. Wherefore, I beg your
Highness to forgive me this presumption, and that you
will be pleased to think well of one who cannot help
resolving, with all the actions of life, to endeavour to
deserve it: nay, more, I would beg, and hope it may be
granted, that I may, through yours, never want an advocate
in his favour, whose heart and mind you have so
entire a share in: it is my only portion and my fortune; I
cannot but be happy so long as I have but hopes I may
enjoy it, and I must be miserable should it ever be my ill
fate to lose it.</p>

<p>This, with eternal wishes for your Royal Highness's
content, happiness, and prosperity, in all humility is
presented by</p>

is a fine one that divides true from false hyperbole, but this
utterance of Castalio has, I think, the real ring of maddened
emotion, which is often absent from Dryden's heroic plays.
Rage and despair do sometimes vent themselves in hyperbole and
trope. Whether the poet can make us feel the utterance to be
inevitable is the question, and that depends on his own sympathy
with the situation.</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> Play is neither more nor less indecent
than Otway's other comedies, but
less uninteresting, on account of its autobiographical
allusions to the writer's
own adventures in Flanders, and the
disbandment without their pay of
the troops he was sent to join. Like
most of the old comedies, this one throws light upon the
manners, customs, and costumes of the period represented.
Its distinctive quality is a certain rollicking vein of fun and
mere buffoonery, together with a rapidity of movement
and variety of incident, that vindicate the work from any
charge of absolute dulness&mdash;nay, it is undeniably amusing
to those whose stomach is strong enough not to be
nauseated with the dirt. The play is not a mere jumble of
bustling incidents, as many of the contemporary comedies
are, written by one who "faggoted his notions as they
fell." At least the main intrigue is regular and connected,
and the characters speak naturally.</p>

<p>Otway wrote hastily, and "lived to please," since he
must "please to live." <i>The Soldier's Fortune</i> is the
kind of thing that pleased very much. For Downes
tells us that the play was extraordinarily successful,
bringing both profit and reputation to the theatre.
Betterton acted the part of Beaugard, and Mrs. Barry
played Lady Dunce. The dedication to Bentley, the
publisher, is unique and curious, while the Epilogue
shows the gloomy and bitter feelings to which the writer
was now frequently a prey. Langbaine and Thornton
have respectively drawn attention to the many different
sources from which much of the plot and material of the
play seems to have been taken. Thus Lady Dunce's
scheme for conveying the ring and letter to her lover
may be found in several earlier plays, and Otway probably
derived it from Moli&egrave;re's <i>L'Ecole des Maris</i>; the
story comes originally from Boccaccio.</p>

<p><i>The Soldier's Fortune</i> was acted in 1681 and printed in
4to in the same year. In 1748 a farce, founded upon it, was
brought out at Covent Garden, but was never printed.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">To Mr. BENTLEY.</span></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/image227i.png" width="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">I</span> have often (during this play's being in
the press) been importuned for a preface;
which you, I suppose, would have
speak something in vindication of the
comedy: now, to please you, Mr. Bentley,
I will, as briefly as I can, speak my
mind upon that occasion, which you may be pleased to
accept of, both as a dedication to yourself, and next as
a preface to the book.</p>

<p>And I am not a little proud that it has happened into
my thoughts to be the first who in these latter years has
made an epistle dedicatory to his stationer: it is a compliment
as reasonable as it is just. For, Mr. Bentley,
you pay honestly for the copy; and an epistle to you is
a sort of an acquittance, and may be probably welcome;
when to a person of higher rank and order, it looks like
an obligation for praises, which he knows he does not
deserve, and therefore is very unwilling to part with
ready money for.</p>

<p>As to the vindication of this comedy, between friends
and acquaintance, I believe it is possible that as much
may be said in its behalf as heretofore has been for a
great many others. But of all the apish qualities about
me, I have not that of being fond of my own issue; nay,
I must confess myself a very unnatural parent, for when
it is once brought into the world, e'en let the brat shift
for itself, I say.</p>

<p>The objections made against the merit of this poor
play, I must confess, are very grievous&mdash;</p>

<p>First, says a lady, that shall be nameless because the
world may think civilly of her: "Faugh! Oh, sherreu!
'tis so filthy, so bawdy, no modest woman ought to be
seen at it: let me die, it has made me sick!" When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
world lies, Mr. Bentley, if that very lady has not easily
digested a much ranker morsel in a little ale-house towards
Paddington, and never made a face at it. But
your true jilt is a creature that can extract bawdy out
of the chastest sense, as easily as a spider can poison out
of a rose; they know true bawdy, let it be never so much
concealed, as perfectly as Falstaff did the true prince by
instinct; they will separate the true metal from the alloy,
let us temper it as well as we can. Some women are the
touchstones of filthiness: though I have heard a lady
(that has more modesty than any of those she-critics, and
I am sure more wit) say, she wondered at the impudence
of any of her sex, that would pretend to understand the
thing called <i>bawdy</i>. So, Mr. Bentley, for aught I perceive,
my play may be innocent yet, and the lady
mistaken in pretending to the knowledge of a mystery
above her; though to speak honestly, she has had,
besides her wit, a liberal education; and if we may credit
the world, has not buried her talent neither.</p>

<p>This is, Mr. Bentley, all I can say in behalf of my play:
wherefore I throw it into your arms; make the best of
it you can; praise it to your customers; sell ten thousand
of them, if possible, and then you will complete the
wishes of</p>

<p class="right">Your Friend and Servant,<br />
THO. OTWAY.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Beau</span>. A pox o' fortune! Thou art
always teasing me about fortune:
thou risest in a morning with ill-luck
in thy mouth; nay, never eatest
a dinner, but thou sighest two hours
after it, with thinking where to get
the next. Fortune be damned, since the world's so
wide!</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> As wide as it is, 'tis so thronged and crammed
with knaves and fools, that an honest man can hardly
get a living in it.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Do, rail, Courtine, do: it may get thee
employment.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> At you I ought to rail; 'twas your fault we
left our employments abroad, to come home and be
loyal; and now we as loyally starve for it.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Did not thy ancestors do it before thee, man?
I tell thee, loyalty and starving are all one. The old
cavaliers got such a trick of it in the king's exile,
that their posterity could never thrive since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> 'Tis a fine equipage I am like to be reduced
to; I shall be ere long as greasy as an Alsatian bully;
this flopping hat, pinned up on one side, with a sandy,
weather-beaten peruke, dirty linen, and, to complete
the figure, a long scandalous iron sword jarring at my
heels, like a&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Snarling, thou meanest, like its master.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> My companions the worthy knights of the
most noble order of the post; your peripatetic
philosophers of the Temple-walks,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> rogues in rags,
and yet not honest; villains that undervalue damnation,
will forswear themselves for a dinner, and hang
their fathers for half-a-crown.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> I am ashamed to hear a soldier talk of
starving.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Why, what shall I do? I can't steal.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Though thou canst not steal, thou hast
other vices enough for any industrious fellow to live
comfortably upon.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> What! wouldst thou have me turn rascal,
and run cheating up and down the town for a livelihood?
I would no more keep a blockhead company,
and endure his nauseous nonsense, in hopes to get
him, than I would be a drudge to an old woman with
rheumatic eyes, hollow teeth, and stinking breath,
for a pension: of all rogues, I would not be a fool-monger.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> How well this niceness becomes thee! I'd
fain see e'en thee turn parson in a pet, o' purpose to
rail at all those vices which I know thou naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>art fond of. Why, surely an old lady's pension need
not be so despicable in the eyes of a disbanded officer,
as times go, friend.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> I am glad, Beaugard, you think so.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Why thou shalt think so too, man; be ruled
by me, and I'll bring thee into good company,&mdash;families,
Courtine, families; and such families, where
formality's a scandal, and pleasure is the business;
where the women are all wanton, and the men all
witty, you rogue.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> What, some of your worship's Wapping
acquaintance, that you made last time you came
over for recruits, and spirited away your landlady's
daughter a-volunteering with you into France?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> I'll bring thee, Courtine, where cuckoldom's
in credit, and lewdness laudable; where thou shalt
wallow in pleasures and preferments, revel all day,
and every night lie in the arms of melting beauty,
sweet as roses, and as springs refreshing.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Pr'ythee don't talk thus; I had rather thou
wouldst tell me where new levies are to be raised: a
pox of whores, when a man has not money to make
'em comfortable!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> That shall shower upon us in abundance;
and for instance, know, to thy everlasting amazement,
all this dropped out of the clouds to-day.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Ha! gold, by this light!</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Out of the clouds?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Ay, gold! does it not smell of the sweet
hand that sent it? Smell&mdash;smell, you dog!</p></div>

<p class="directright">[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Fourbin</span>.</p>

<p class="directright">[<span class="smcap">Fourbin</span> <i>smells the handful of gold, and</i>
<i>gathers up some pieces in his mouth</i>.</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Four.</i> Truly, sir, of heavenly sweetness, and very
refreshing.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Dear Beaugard, if thou hast any good-nature
in thee, if thou wouldst not have me hang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
myself before my time, tell me where the devil
haunts that helped thee to this, that I may go make
a bargain with him presently: speak, speak, or I am
a lost man.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Why, thou must know this devil, which I
have given my soul to already, and must I suppose
have my body very speedily, lives I know not where,
and may, for aught I know, be a real devil; but if it
be, 'tis the best natured devil under Beelzebub's
dominions,&mdash;that I'll swear to.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> But how came the gold, then?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> To deal freely with my friend, I am lately
happened into the acquaintance of a very reverend
pimp, as fine a discreet, sober, grey-bearded old
gentleman as one would wish; as good a natured
public-spirited person as the nation holds; one that
is never so happy as when he is bringing good people
together, and promoting civil understanding betwixt
the sexes: nay, rather than want employment, he
will go from one end of the town to t'other, to procure
my lord's little dog to be civil to my lady's little
languishing bitch.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> A very worthy member of the commonwealth!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> This noble person one day&mdash;but Fourbin
can give you a more particular account of the matter.
Sweet sir, if you please, tell us the story of the first
encounter betwixt you and Sir Jolly Jumble. You
must know that's his title.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Sir, it shall be done. Walking one day upon
the Piazza,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> about three of the clock i' the afternoon,
to get me a stomach to my dinner, I chanced to
encounter a person of goodly presence and worthy
appearance; his beard and hair white, grave, and
comely; his countenance ruddy, plump, smooth, and
cheerful; who perceiving me also equipped as I am,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>with a mien and air which might well inform him I
was a person of no inconsiderable quality, came very
respectfully up to me, and, after the usual ceremonies
between persons of parts and breeding had passed,
very humbly inquired of me "What is it o'clock?" I
presently understanding by the question that he was a
man of parts and business, told him I did presume it
was at most but nicely turned of three.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Very court-like, civil, quaint, and new, I
think.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> The freedom of commerce increasing, after
some little inconsiderable questions <i>pour passer le</i>
<i>temps</i>, and so, he was pleased to offer me the courtesy
of a glass of wine: I told him I very seldom drank,
but, if he so pleased, I would do myself the honour
to present him with a dish of meat at an eating-house
hard by, where I had an interest.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Very well: I think this squire of thine,
Beaugard, is as accomplished a person as any of the
employment I ever saw.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Let the rogue go on.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> In short, we agreed and went together. As
soon as we entered the room, "I am your most
humble servant, sir," says he. "I am the meanest
of your vassals, sir," said I. "I am very happy in
lighting into the acquaintance of so worthy a gentleman
as you appear to be, sir," said he again. "Worthy
Sir Jolly,"&mdash;then came I upon him again on t'other
side (for you must know by that time I had groped
out his title), "I kiss your hands from the bottom of
my heart, which I shall be always ready to lay at
your feet."</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Well, Fourbin, and what replied the knight
then?</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Nothing, he had nothing to say; his sense
was transported with admiration of my parts: so we
sat down, and after some pause, he desired to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
by what title he was to distinguish the person that
had so highly honoured him.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> That is as much as to say, sir, whose rascal
you were.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Sir, you may make as bold with your poor
slave as you please.&mdash;I told him those that knew me
well were pleased to call me the Chevalier Fourbin;
that I was a cadet of the ancient family of the Fourbinois;
and that I had had the honour of serving the
great monarch of France in his wars in Flanders,
where I contracted great familiarity and intimacy
with a gallant officer of the English troops in that
service, one Captain Beaugard.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Oh, sir, you did me too much honour. What
a true-bred rogue's this!</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Well, but the money, Fourbin, the money?</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> "Beaugard, hum! Beaugard," says he&mdash;"ay,
it must be so,&mdash;a black man, is he not?" "Ay," says
I, "blackish&mdash;a dark brown." "Full-faced?" "Yes."
"A sly, subtle, observing eye?" "The same." "A
strong-built, well-made man?" "Right." "A devilish
fellow for a wench, a devilish fellow for a wench, I
warrant him; a thundering rogue upon occasion&mdash;Beaugard!
a thundering fellow for a wench: I must
be acquainted with him."</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> But to the money, the money, man; that's
the thing I would be acquainted withal.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> This civil gentleman of the chevalier's acquaintance
comes yesterday morning to my lodging,
and seeing my picture in miniature upon the toilet,
told me, with the greatest ecstasy in the world, that
was the thing he came to me about: he told me there
was a lady of his acquaintance had some favourable
thoughts of me, and "I'gad," says he, "she's a
hummer; such a <i>bona roba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> ah!"&mdash;So without more
ado begs me to lend it him till dinner (for we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>concluded to eat together); so away he scuttled with
as great joy as if he had found the philosopher's
stone.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Very well.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> At Locket's<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> we met again; where after a
thousand grimaces, to show how much he was
pleased, instead of my picture, presents me with the
contents aforesaid; and told me the lady desired me
to accept of them for the picture, which she was
much transported withal, as well as with the original.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Ha!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Now, whereabouts this taking quality lies in
me, the devil take me, Ned, if I know; but the fates,
Ned, the fates!</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> A curse on the fates! Of all strumpets, fortune's
the basest. 'Twas fortune made me a soldier,
a rogue in red, the grievance of the nation; fortune
made the peace just when we were on the brink of a
war; then fortune disbanded us, and lost us two
months' pay: fortune gave us debentures instead of
ready money, and by very good fortune I sold mine,
and lost heartily by it, in hopes the grinding ill-natured
dog that bought it will never get a shilling
for't.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Leave off thy railing, for shame! it looks
like a cur that barks for want of bones. Come, times
may mend, and an honest soldier be in fashion again.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> These greasy, fat, unwieldy, wheezing rogues
that live at home, and brood over their bags, when a
fit of fear's upon them, then if one of us pass but by,
all the family is ready at the door to cry, "Heavens
bless you, sir! the Laird go along with you!"</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> "Ah, good men; what pity 'tis such proper
gentlemen should ever be out of employment!"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
<p><i>Cour.</i> But when the business is over, then every
parish bawd that goes but to a conventicle twice a
week, and pays but scot and lot to the parish, shall
roar out, "Faugh, ye lousy red-coat rake-hells! hout,
ye caterpillars, ye locusts of the nation! you are the
dogs that would enslave us all, plunder our shops,
and ravish our daughters, ye scoundrels!"</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> I must confess ravishing ought to be regulated;
it would destroy commerce, and many a good
sober matron about this town might lose the selling
of her daughter's maidenhead, which were a great
grievance to the people, and a particular branch of
property lost. Fourbin!</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Your worship's pleasure?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Run, like a rogue as you are, and try to find
Sir Jolly, and desire him to meet me at the Blue-Posts
in the Haymarket about twelve; we'll dine
together. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Fourbin</span>.] I must inquire farther
into yesterday's adventure; in the mean time, Ned,
here's half the prize, to be doing withal: old friends
must preserve correspondence; we have shared good
fortune together, and bad shall never part us.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Well, thou wilt certainly die in a ditch for
this: hast thou no more grace than to be a true
friend? nay, to part with thy money to thy friend?
I grant you, a gentleman may swear and lie for his
friend, pimp for his friend, hang for his friend, and
so forth; but to part with ready money is the devil.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Stand aside; either I am mistaken, or
yonder's Sir Jolly coming: now, Courtine, will I
show thee the flower of knighthood. Ah, Sir Jolly!</p></div>

<p><i>Beau.</i> But the lady, Sir Jolly, the lady; how does
the lady? what says the lady, Sir Jolly?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> What says the lady! why, she says&mdash;she
says&mdash;odd, she has a delicate lip, such a lip, so red,
so hard, so plump, so blub; I fancy I am eating
cherries every time I think on't&mdash;and for her neck
and breasts, and her&mdash;odd's life! I'll say no more,

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Hush, hush, hush! have a care; as I live
and breathe, not I; alack and well-a-day, I am a
poor old fellow, decayed and done: all's gone with
me, gentlemen, but my good-nature; odd, I love to
know how matters go though now and then, to see a
pretty wench and a young fellow touze and rouze
and frouze and mouze; odd, I love a young fellow
dearly, faith dearly!</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> This is the most extraordinary rogue I ever
met withal.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> But, Sir Jolly, in the first place, you must
know I have sworn never to marry.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> I would not have thee, man: I am a
bachelor myself and have been a whore-master all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>my life;&mdash;besides, she's married already, man; her
husband's an old, greasy, untoward, ill-natured,
slovenly, tobacco-taking cuckold; but plaguy jealous.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Already a cuckold, Sir Jolly?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> No, that shall be, my boy; thou shalt
make him one, and I'll pimp for thee, dear heart; and
shan't I hold the door? shan't I peep, ha? shan't I,
you devil, you little dog, shan't I?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> What is it I'd not grant to oblige my patron!</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> And then dost hear? I have a lodging
for thee in my own house: dost hear, old soul? in
my own house; she lives the very next door, man;
there's but a wall to part her chamber and thine; and
then for a peep-hole&mdash;odd's fish, I have a peep-hole
for thee; 'sbud, I'll show thee, I'll show thee&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> But when, Sir Jolly? I am in haste, impatient.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Why, this very night, man; poor rogue's
in haste, poor rogue; but hear you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> The matter?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Shan't we dine together?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> With all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> The Mall begins to empty. Get you before,
and bespeak dinner at the Blue-Posts; while I
stay behind and gather up a dish of whores for a
dessert.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Be sure that they be lewd, drunken, stripping
whores, Sir Jolly, that won't be affectedly squeamish
and troublesome.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> I love a well-disciplined whore, that shows
all the tricks of her profession with a wink, like an
old soldier that understands all his exercise by beat
of drum.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Ah, thief, sayest thou so? I must be better
acquainted with that fellow; he has a notable nose;
a hard brawny carle, true and trusty, and mettle,
I'll warrant him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Well, Sir Jolly, you'll not fail us?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Fail ye! am I a knight? hark ye, boys: I'll
muster this evening such a regiment of rampant, roaring,
roisterous whores, that shall make more noise than
if all the cats in the Haymarket were in conjunction;
whores, ye rogues, that shall swear with you, drink
with you, talk bawdy with you, fight with you, scratch
with you, lie with you, and go to the devil with you.
Shan't we be very merry, ha?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> As merry as wine, women, and wickedness
can make us.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Odd, that's well said again, very well said;
as merry as wine, women, and wickedness can
make us. I love a fellow that's very wicked
dearly: methinks there's a spirit in him, there's a
sort of tantara-rara; tantara-rara, ah, ah! well, and
won't ye, when the women come, won't ye, and shall
I not see a little sport amongst you? well, get ye

<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Dunce</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>.
</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Die a maid, Sylvia, fie, for shame! what
a scandalous resolution's that! Five thousand pounds
to your portion, and leave it all to hospitals, for the
innocent recreation hereafter of leading apes in hell?<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
fie, for shame!</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Indeed, such another charming animal as
your consort, Sir Davy, might do much with me; 'tis
an unspeakable blessing to lie all night by a horseload
of diseases; a beastly, unsavoury, old, groaning,
grunting, wheezing wretch, that smells of the grave
he's going to already. From such a curse, and haircloth
next my skin, good Heaven deliver me!</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Thou mistakest the use of a husband,
Sylvia: they are not meant for bedfellows; heretofore,
indeed, 'twas a fulsome fashion, to lie o' nights
with a husband; but the world's improved, and
customs altered.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Pray instruct me then what the use of a
husband is.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Instead of a gentleman-usher for ceremony's
sake, to be in waiting on set days and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>particular occasions; but the friend, cousin, is the
jewel unvaluable.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> But Sir Davy, madam, will be difficult to be
so governed; I am mistaken if his nature is not too
jealous to be blinded.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> So much the better; of all, the jealous
fool is easiest to be deceived: for observe, where
there's jealousy there's always fondness; which if a
woman, as she ought to do, will make the right use
of, the husband's fears shall not so awake him on one
side, as his dotage shall blind him on the other.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Is your piece of mortality such a doting
doodle? is he so very fond of you?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> No, but he has the vanity to think that
I am very fond of him; and if he be jealous, 'tis not
so much for fear I do abuse, as that in time I may,
and therefore imposes this confinement on me; though
he has other divertisements that take him off from
my enjoyment, which make him so loathsome no
woman but must hate him.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> His private divertisements I am a stranger
to.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Then for his person, 'tis incomparably
odious; he has such a breath, one kiss of him were
enough to cure the fits of the mother;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> 'tis worse than
assaf&oelig;tida.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Oh, hideous!</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Everything that's nasty he affects:
clean linen he says is unwholesome; and to make
him more charming, he's continually eating of garlic
and chewing tobacco.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Faugh! this is love! this is the blessing of
matrimony!</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Rail not so unreasonably against love,
Sylvia. As I have dealt freely, and acknowledged to
thee the passion I have for Beaugard, so methinks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>Sylvia need not conceal her good thoughts of her
friend. Do not I know Courtine sticks in your
stomach?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> If he does, I'll assure you he shall never get
to my heart. But can you have the conscience to
love another man now you are married? What do
you think will become of you?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> I tell thee, Sylvia, I was never married
to that engine we have been talking of; my parents
indeed made me say something to him after a priest
once, but my heart went not along with my tongue;
I minded not what it was: for my thoughts, Sylvia,
for these seven years, have been much better
employed&mdash;Beaugard! Ah, curse on the day that
first sent him into France!</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Why so, I beseech you?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Had he stayed here, I had not been
sacrificed to the arms of this monument of man, for
the bed of death could not be more cold than his has
been: he would have delivered me from the monster,
for even then I loved him, and was apt to think my
kindness not neglected.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> I find indeed your ladyship had good thoughts
of him.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Surely 'tis impossible to think too well
of him, for he has wit enough to call his good-nature
in question, and yet good-nature enough to make his
wit suspected.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> But how do you hope ever to get sight of
him? Sir Davy's watchfulness is invincible. I dare
swear he would smell out a rival if he were in the
house, only by natural instinct; as some that always
sweat when a cat's in the room. Then again,
Beaugard's a soldier, and that's a thing the old
gentleman, you know, loves dearly.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> There lies the greatest comfort of my
uneasy life; he is one of those fools, forsooth, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
are led by the nose by knaves to rail against the
king and the government, and is mightily fond of
being thought of a party. I have had hopes this
twelve-month to have heard of his being in the Gatehouse<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
for treason.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> But I find only yourself the prisoner all this
while.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> At present indeed I am so; but fortune
I hope will smile, wouldst thou but be my friend,
Sylvia.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> In any mischievous design, with all my heart.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> The conclusion, madam, may turn to
your satisfaction. But you have no thoughts of
Courtine?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Not I, I'll assure you, cousin.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> You don't think him well shaped, straight,
and proportionable?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Considering he eats but once a week, the man
is well enough.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> And then he wears his clothes, you
know, filthily, and like a horrid sloven.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Filthily enough of all conscience, with a
threadbare red coat, which his tailor duns him for to
this day, over which a great, broad, greasy, buff-belt,
enough to turn any one's stomach but a disbanded
soldier; a peruke tied up in a knot, to excuse its
want of combing; and then, because he has been a
man at arms, he must wear two tuffles of a beard,
forsooth, to lodge a dunghill of snuff upon, to keep
his nose in good humour.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Nay, now I am sure that thou lovest him.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> So far from it, that I protest eternally against
the whole sex.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> That time will best demonstrate; in the
mean while to our business.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
<p><i>Sylv.</i> As how, madam?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> To-night must I see Beaugard; they are
this minute at dinner in the Haymarket; now to
make my evil genius, that haunts me everywhere, my
thing called a husband, himself to assist his poor
wife at a dead lift, I think would not be unpleasant.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> But 'twill be impossible.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> I am apt to be persuaded rather very
easy. You know our good and friendly neighbour, Sir
Jolly.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Out on him, beast! he's always talking
filthily to a body; if he sits but at the table with one,
he'll be making nasty figures in the napkins.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> He and my sweet yoke-fellow are the
most intimate friends in the world; so that partly
out of neighbourly kindness, as well as the great
delight he takes to be meddling in matters of this
nature, with a great deal of pains and industry he
has procured me Beaugard's picture, and given him
to understand how well a friend of his in petticoats,
called myself, wishes him.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> But what's all this to the making the husband
instrumental? for I must confess, of all creatures, a
husband's the thing that's odious to me.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> That must be done this night: I'll instantly
to my chamber, take my bed in a pet, and
send for Sir Davy.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> But which way then must the lover come?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Nay, I'll betray Beaugard to him, show
him the picture he sent me, and beg of him, as he
tenders his own honour and my quiet, to take some
course to secure me from the scandalous solicitations
of that innocent fellow.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> And so make him the property, the go-between,
to bring the affair to an issue the more
decently.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Right, Sylvia; 'tis the best office a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
husband can do a wife; I mean an old husband.
Bless us, to be yoked in wedlock with a paralytic,
coughing, decrepit dotterel; to be a dry-nurse all
one's life-time to an old child of sixty-five; to lie by
the image of death a whole night, a dull immoveable,

age.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Nay, now, sir, you honour
me too far.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> He's the delight of the young,
and wonder of the old.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> I swear, gentlemen, you make me blush.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> He deserves a statue of gold, at the charge
of the kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Out upon't, fie for shame! I protest I'll
leave your company if you talk so. But faith they
were pure whores, daintily dutiful strumpets: ha!
uddsbud, they'd&mdash;have stripped for t'other bottle.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Truly, Sir Jolly, you are a man of very
extraordinary discipline: I never saw whores under
better command in my life.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Pish, that's nothing, man, nothing; I can
send for forty better when I please; doxies that will
skip, strip, leap, trip, and do anything in the world,
anything, old soul!</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Dear, dear Sir Jolly, where and when?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Odd! as simply as I stand here, her
father was a knight.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Indeed, Sir Jolly! a knight, say you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Ay, but a little decayed: I'll assure you
she's a very good gentlewoman born.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Ay, and a very good gentlewoman bred too.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Ay, and so she is.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> But, Sir Jolly, how goes my business
forward? when shall I have a view of the quarry I
am to fly at?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Alas-a-day, not so hasty; soft and fair, I
beseech you. Ah, my little son of thunder, if thou
hadst her in thy arms now between a pair of sheets,
and I under the bed to see fair play, boy; gemini!
what would become of me? what would become of
me? there would be doings! O lawd, I under the
bed!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Or behind the hangings, Sir Jolly, would
not that do as well?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Ah no, under the bed against the world,
and then it would be very dark, ha!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Dark to choose?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> No, but a little light would do well; a
small glimmering lamp, just enough for me to steal
a peep by; oh, lamentable! oh, lamentable! I won't
speak a word more! there would be a trick! O rare!
you friend, O rare! Odds-so, not a word more, odds-so,
yonder comes the monster that must be the
cuckold-elect; step, step aside and observe him; if I
should be seen in your company, 'twould spoil all.</p></div>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Beau.</i> For my part, I'll stand the meeting of him;
one way to promote a good understanding with a wife,
is first to get acquainted with her husband.            <span class="directline">[<i>Retires.</i></span></p></div>

<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Davy Dunce</span>.
</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Well, of all blessings, a discreet wife is
the greatest that can light upon a man of years: had
I been married to anything but an angel now, what
a beast had I been by this time! well, I am the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
happiest old fool! 'tis a horrid age that we live in,
so that an honest man can keep nothing to himself.
If you have a good estate, every covetous rogue is
longing for't (truly I love a good estate dearly myself);
if you have a handsome wife, every smooth-faced
coxcomb will be combing and cocking<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> at her: flesh-flies
are not so troublesome to the shambles as those
sort of insects are to the boxes in the play-house.
But virtue is a great blessing, an unvaluable treasure:
to tell me herself that a villain had tempted her, and
give me the very picture, the enchantment that he
sent to bewitch her! it strikes me dumb with admiration.
Here's the villain in effigy.                      [<i>Pulls out the</i>
<i>picture.</i>] Odd! a very handsome fellow, a dangerous
rogue, I'll warrant him: such fellows as these now
should be fettered like unruly colts, that they might
not leap into other men's pastures. Here's a nose
now, I could find it in my heart to cut it off. Damned
dog, to dare to presume to make a cuckold of a
knight!&mdash;bless us! what will this world come to?
Well, poor Sir Davy, down, down on thy knees,
and thank thy stars for this deliverance.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> 'Sdeath! what's that I see? sure 'tis the
very picture which I sent by Sir Jolly; if so, by this
light, I am damnably jilted.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> But now if&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Surely he does not see us yet.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> See you, sir! why he has but one eye, and
we are on his blind side; I'll dumb-found him. <span class="directline">[<i>Strikes him on the shoulder.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Who the devil's this? Sir, sir, sir, who
are you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Ay, ay, 'tis the same; now a pox of all amorous
adventures! 'sdeath, I'll go beat the impertinent
pimp that drew me into this fooling.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Sir, methinks you are very curious.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
<p><i>Beau.</i> Sir, perhaps I have an extraordinary reason
to be so.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> And perhaps, sir, I care not for you, nor
your reasons neither.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Sir, if you are at leisure, I would beg the
honour to speak with you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> With me, sir? what's your business with
me?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> I would not willingly be troublesome, though
it may be I am so at this time.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> It may be so too, sir.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> But to be known to so worthy a person as
you are, would be so great an honour, so extraordinary
a happiness, that I could not avoid taking this
opportunity of tendering you my service.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Smooth rogue! who the devil
is this fellow? But, sir, you were pleased to nominate
business, sir; I desire with what speed you can
to know your business, sir, that I may go about my
business.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Sir, if I might with good manners, I should
be glad to inform myself whose picture that is which
you have in your hand; methinks it is a very fine
painting.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Picture, friend, picture! sir, 'tis a resemblance
of a very impudent fellow; they call him
Captain Beaugard, forsooth, but he is in short a
rake-hell, a poor, lousy, beggarly, disbanded devil;
do you know him, friend?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> I think I have heard of such a vagabond:
the truth on't is, he is a very impudent fellow.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ay, a damned rogue.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Oh, a notorious scoundrel.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> I expect to hear he's hanged by next
sessions.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> The truth on't is, he has deserved it long
ago. But did you ever see him, Sir Davy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Sir!&mdash;does he know me?                     <span class="directline">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Because I fancy that miniature is very like
him. Pray, sir, whence had it you?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Had it, friend? had it? whence had it I?
[<i>Aside.</i>] Bless us!  [<i>Compares the picture with</i> <span class="smcap">Beaugard's</span>
<i>face</i>.] what have I done now! this is the very
traitor himself; if he should be desperate now, and
put his sword in my guts!&mdash;slitting my nose will be
as bad as that, I have but one eye left neither, and
may be&mdash;Oh, but this is the King's Court; odd,
that's well remembered; he dares not but be civil
here. I'll try to out-huff him. Whence had it you?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Ay, sir, whence had it you? that's English
in my country, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Go, sir, you are a rascal.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> How!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Sir, I say you are a rascal, a very impudent
rascal; nay, I'll prove you to be a rascal, if you
go to that&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Sir, I am a gentleman and a soldier.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> So much the worse; soldiers have been
cuckold-makers from the beginning: sir, I care not
what you are; for aught I know you may be a&mdash;come,
sir, did I never see you? Answer me to that; did I
never see you? for aught I know you may be a Jesuit;
there were more in the last army beside you.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Of your acquaintance, and be hanged!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Yes, to my knowledge there were several
at Hounslow-heath, disguised in dirty petticoats, and
cried brandy. I knew a sergeant of foot that was
familiar with one of them all night in a ditch, and
fancied him a woman; but the devil is powerful.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> In short, you worthy villain of worship, that
picture is mine, and I must have it, or I shall take
an opportunity to kick your worship most inhumanly.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Kick, sir!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Ay, sir, kick; 'tis a recreation I can show you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Sir, I am a free-born subject of England,
and there are laws, look you, there are laws; so I say
you are a rascal again, and now how will you help
yourself, poor fool?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Hark you, friend, have not you a wife?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> I have a lady, sir&mdash;oh, and she's mightily
taken with this picture of yours; she was so mightily
proud of it, she could not forbear showing it me, and
telling too who it was sent it her.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> And has she been long a jilt? has she
practised the trade for any time?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Trade! humph, what trade? what trade,
friend?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Why the trade of whore and no whore,
caterwauling in jest, putting out Christian colours,
when she's a Turk under deck. A curse upon all
honest women in the flesh, that are whores in the
spirit!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Poor devil, how he rails! ha, ha, ha!
Look you, sweet soul, as I told you before, there are
laws, there are laws, but those are things not worthy
your consideration: beauty's your business. But,
dear vagabond, trouble thyself no further about my
spouse; let my doxy rest in peace, she's meat for
thy master, old boy; I have my belly-full of her
every night.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Sir, I wish all your noble family hanged from
the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Moreover, Captain Swash, I must tell
you my wife is a honest woman, of a virtuous disposition,
one that I have loved from her infancy, and
she deserves it by her faithful dealing in this affair, for
that she has discovered loyally to me the treacherous
designs laid against her chastity, and my honour.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> By this light, the beast weeps!               <span class="directline">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Truly I cannot but weep for joy, to think
how happy I am in a sincere, faithful, and loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
yoke-fellow. She charged me too to tell you into
the bargain, that she is sufficiently satisfied of the
most secret wishes of your heart.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> I'm glad on't.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> And that 'tis her desire that you would
trouble yourself no more about the matter.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> With all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> But henceforward behave yourself with
such discretion as becomes a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Oh, to be sure, most exactly!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> And let her alone to make the best use
of those innocent freedoms I allow her, without
putting her reputation in hazard.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> As how, I beseech you?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> By your impertinent and unseasonable
address.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> And this news you bring me by a particular
commission from your sweet lady?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Yea, friend, I do; and she hopes you'll
be sensible, dear heart, of her good meaning by it:
these were her very words, I neither add nor diminish,
for plain-dealing is my mistress's friend.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Then all the curses I shall think on this
twelvemonth light on her, and as many more on the
next fool that gives credit to the sex!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Well, certainly I am the happiest toad!
How melancholy the monkey stands now! Poor pug,
hast thou lost her?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> To be so sordid a jilt, to betray me to such
a beast as that! Can she have any good thoughts
of such a swine? Damn her, had she abused me
handsomely it had never vexed me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Now, sir, with your permission I'll take
my leave.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Sir, if you were gone to the devil I should
think you very well disposed of.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> If you have any letter, or other com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>mendation
to the lady that was so charmed with your
resemblance there, it shall be very faithfully conveyed
by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Fool!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Your humble servant. Sir, I'm gone; I
shall disturb you no further; your most humble
servant, sir.                                              [<i>Exit.</i></p>

thy time.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> I hope I have lost nothing in your honour's
service, sir.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Find out some way to revenge me on this
old rascal, and if I do not make thee a gentleman&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> That you have been pleased to do long ago,
I thank you; for I am sure you have not left me one
shilling in my pocket these two months.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Will your honour please to have his throat
cut?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> With all my heart.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Or would you have him decently hanged at
his own door, and then give out to the world he did
it himself?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> That would do very well.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Or I think (to proceed with more safety) a
good stale jakes<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> were a very pretty expedient.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Take my word, sir, you had better give this
business over. I tell you, there's nothing in the world
turns my stomach so much as the man, that man
that makes love to me. I never saw one of your sex
in my life make love, but he looked so like an ass all
the while, that I blushed for him.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> I am afraid your ladyship then is one of
those dangerous creatures they call she-wits, who
are always so mightily taken with admiring themselves
that nothing else is worth their notice.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Oh, who can be so dull, not to be ravished
with that roisterous mien of yours, that ruffling air in
your gait, that seems to cry where'er you go, "Make
room, here comes the captain!" that face which bids
defiance to the weather? Bless us! if I were a poor
farmer's wife in the country now, and you wanted
quarters, how would it fright me! But as I am
young, not very ugly, and one you never saw before,
how lovingly it looks upon me!</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Who can forbear to sigh, look pale, and
languish, where beauty and wit unite both their
forces to enslave a heart so tractable as mine is?
First, for that modish swim of your body, the
victorious motion of your arms and head, the toss
of your fan, the glancing of the eyes&mdash;bless us! if I
were a dainty fine-dressed coxcomb, with a great
estate, and a little or no wit, vanity in abundance
and good for nothing, how would they melt and
soften me! but as I am a scandalous honest rascal,
not fool enough to be your sport, nor rich enough to
be your prey, how gloatingly they look upon me!</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Alas, alas! what pity 'tis your honesty should
ever do you hurt, or your wit spoil your preferment!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Just as much, fair lady, as that your beauty
should make you be envied at, or your virtue provoke
scandal.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Well, the more I look, the more I'm in love
with you.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> The more I look, the more I am out of love
with you.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> How my heart swells when I see you!</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> How my stomach rises when I am near you!</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Nay, then let's bargain.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> With all my heart; what?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Not to fall in love with each other; I assure
you, Monsieur Captain.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> But to hate one another constantly and
cordially.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Always when you are drunk, I desire you to
talk scandalously of me.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Ay, and when I am sober too; in return
whereof, whene'er you see a coquette of your
acquaintance, and I chance to be named, be sure
you spit at the filthy remembrance, and rail at me as
if you loved me.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> In the next place, whene'er we meet in the
Mall, I desire you to "Humph!" put out your tongue,
make ugly mouths, laugh aloud, and look back at me.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Which, if I chance to do, be sure at next
turning to pick up some tawdry fluttering fop or
another.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> That I made acquaintance withal at the
music-meeting?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Right, just such another spark to saunter by
your side, with his hat under his arm.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Hearkening to all the bitter things I can say
to be revenged.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Whilst the dull rogue dare not so much as
grin to oblige you, for fear of being beaten for it,
when he is out of his waiting.</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Cour.</i> Curse on him for a rogue, I know him.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> So.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> The rascal was a retailer of ale but yesterday,
and now he is an officer and be hanged; 'tis a
dainty sight in a morning to see him with his toes
turned in, drawing his legs after him, at the head of
a hundred lusty fellows. Some honest gentleman or
other stays now, because that dog had money to
bribe some corrupt colonel withal.</p></div>

<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter another, gravely dressed.</i>
</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Beau.</i> There, there's another of my acquaintance;
he was my father's footman not long since, and has
pimped for me oftener than he prayed for himself;
that good quality recommended him to a nobleman's
service, which, together with flattering, fawning,
lying, spying and informing, has raised him to an
employment of trust and reputation, though the
rogue can't write his name, nor read his neck-verse,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
if he had occasion.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> 'Tis as unreasonable to expect a man of
sense should be preferred, as 'tis to think a hector
can be stout, a priest religious, a fair woman chaste,
or a pardoned rebel loyal.</p></div>

<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter two others, seeming earnestly in discourse.</i>
</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Beau.</i> That's seasonably thought on. Look there,
observe but that fellow on the right hand, the rogue
with the busiest face of the two; I'll tell thee his
history.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
<p><i>Cour.</i> I hope hanging will be the end of his
history, so well I like him at the first sight.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> He was born a vagabond, and no parish
owned him: his father was as obscure as his mother
public; everybody knew her, and nobody could
guess at him.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> He comes of a very good family, Heaven be
praised!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> The first thing he chose to rise by was
rebellion; so a rebel he grew, and flourished a
rebel; fought against his king, and helped to bring
him to the block.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> And was he not religious too?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Most devoutly! he could pray till he cried,
and preach till he foamed; which excellent talent
made him popular, and at last preferred him to be a
worthy member of that never-to-be-forgotten Rump
Parliament.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Pray, sir, be uncovered at that, and remember
it with reverence.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> In short, he was a committee-man, sequestrator
and persecutor-general of a whole county, by
which he got enough at the king's return to secure
himself in the general pardon.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Nauseous vermin! that such a swine, with
the mark of rebellion in his forehead, should wallow
in his luxury, whilst honest men are forgotten!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Thus forgiven, thus raised, and made thus
happy, the ungrateful slave disowns the hand that
healed him, cherishes factions to affront his master,
and once more would rebel against the head which
so lately saved his from a pole.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> What a dreadful beard and swinging sword
he wears!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> 'Tis to keep his cowardice in countenance;
the rascal will endure kicking most temperately for
all that; I know five or six more of the same stamp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
that never come abroad without terrible long spits
by their sides, with which they will let you bore
their own noses if you please. But let the villain be
forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> His co-rogue I have some knowledge of;
he's a tattered worm-eaten case-putter; some call
him lawyer; one that takes it very ill he is not
made a judge.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Yes, and is always repining that men of
parts are not regarded.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> He has been a great noise-maker in factious
clubs these seven years, and now I suppose is courting
that worshipful rascal, to make him recorder of some
factious town.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> To teach tallow-chandlers and cheesemongers
how far they may rebel against their king
by virtue of Magna Charta.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> But, friend Beaugard, methinks thou art
very splenetic of a sudden: how goes the affair of
love forward? prosperously, ha?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Oh, I assure you most triumphantly; just
now, you must know, I am parted with the sweet,
civil, enchanted lady's husband.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Well, and what says the cuckold? is he very
kind and good-natured, as cuckolds use to be?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Why, he says, Courtine, in short, that I am
a very silly fellow&mdash;and truly I am very apt to
believe him&mdash;and that I have been jilted in this
affair most unconscionably. A plague on all pimps,
I say; a man's business never thrives so well as
when he is his own solicitor.</p></div>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Methinks this face should not so much
be altered, as to be nothing like what I once thought
it, the object of your pleasure, and subject of your
praises.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Cunning toad! wheedling jade! you shall
see now how by degrees she'll draw him into the
whirlpool of love: now he leers upon her, now he
leers upon her. O law! there's eyes! there's eyes!
I must pinch him by the calf of the leg.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Madam, I must confess I do remember that
I had once acquaintance with a face whose air and
beauty much resembled yours; and, if I may trust
my heart, you are called Clarinda.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Clarinda I was called, till my ill-fortune
wedded me; now you may have heard of me by
another title: your friend there, I suppose, has made
nothing a secret to you.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> And are you then that kind enchanted fair
one who was so passionately in love with my picture
that you could not forbear betraying me to the beast
your husband, and wrong the passion of a gentleman

of your person?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Yes, madam, when I receive so good
hostages as these are&mdash;[<i>Shows the gold</i>]&mdash;that it shall
be well used. Could you find nobody but me to play
the fool withal?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Alack-a-day!</p>

wretched woman that has loved you too well to

dirt; I scorn your wages, as I do your service.</p>

not like a soldier, to refund: keep, keep it to pay

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Sylv</span>. To fall in love, and to fall in
love with a soldier! nay, a disbanded
soldier too; a fellow with the mark
of Cain upon him, which everybody
knows him by, and is ready to throw
stones at him for.</p></div>

<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Courtine</span>.
</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Cour.</i> Damn her! I shall never enjoy her without
ravishing; if she were but very rich and very ugly,
I would marry her. Ay, 'tis she; I know her
mischievous look too well to be mistaken in it.&mdash;Madam.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Sir.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> 'Tis a very hard case, that you have resolved
not to let me be quiet.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> 'Tis very unreasonably done of you, sir, to
haunt me up and down everywhere at this scandalous
rate; the world will think we are acquainted, shortly.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> But, madam, I shall fairly take more care of
my reputation, and from this time forward shun and
avoid you most watchfully.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Have you not haunted this place these two
hours?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> 'Twas because I knew it to be your ladyship's
home, then, and therefore might reasonably be
the place you least of all frequented; one would
imagine you were gone a-coxcomb-hunting by this
time, to some place of public appearance or other;
'tis pretty near the hour; 'twill be twilight presently,
and then the owls come all abroad.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> What need I take the trouble to go so far a-fowling,
when there's game enough at our own doors?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> What, game for your net, fair lady?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Yes, or any woman's net else, that will spread it.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> To show you how despicably I think of the
business, I will here leave you presently, though I
lose the pleasure of railing at you.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Do so, I would advise you; your raillery
betrays your wit, as bad as your clumsy civility does
your breeding.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Adieu!</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Farewell!</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Why do not you go about your business?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Because I would be sure to be rid of you
first, that you might not dog me.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Were it but possible that you could answer
me one question truly, and then I should be satisfied.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Any thing for composition to be rid of you
handsomely.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Are you really very honest? look in my face,
and tell me that.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Look in your face and tell you! for what?
to spoil my stomach to my supper?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> No, but to get thee a stomach to thy bed,
sweetheart; I would if possible be better acquainted
with thee, because thou art very ill-natured.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Your only way to bring that business about
effectually, is to be more troublesome; and if you
think it worth your while to be abused substantially,
you may make your personal appearance this night.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> How? where? and when? and what hour, I

eleven and twelve exactly.</p></div>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Here's another trick of the devil now; under
that window between the hours of eleven and twelve
exactly! I am a damned fool, and must go: let me
see; suppose I meet with a lusty beating: pish,
that's nothing for a man that's in love; or suppose
she contrive some way to make a public coxcomb of
me, and expose me to the scorn of the world, for an
example to all amorous blockheads hereafter? why,
if she do, I'll swear I have lain with her; beat her
relations, if they pretend to vindicate her; and so
there's one love-intrigue pretty well over.                [<i>Exit.</i></p></div>

<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Davy Dunce</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Vermin</span>.
</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Go, get you in to your lady now, and tell
her I am coming.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Her ladyship, right worshipful, is pleased not
to be at home.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> How's that? my lady not at home!
Run, run in and ask when she went forth, whither she
is gone, and who is with her; run and ask, Vermin.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> She went out in her chair presently after you
this afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Then I may be a cuckold still for aught
I know: what will become of me? I have surely lost,
and ne'er shall find her more; she promised me
strictly to stay at home till I came back again; for
aught I know she may be up three pair of stairs in
the Temple now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Is her ladyship in law then, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Or it may be taking the air as far as
Knightsbridge, with some smooth-faced rogue or
another. 'Tis a damned house, that Swan: that
Swan at Knightsbridge is a confounded house,
Vermin.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Do you think she is there then?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> No, I do not think she is there neither;
but such a thing may be, you know: would that
Barn-Elms was under water too! there's a thousand
cuckolds a year made at Barn-Elms by Rosamond's
Ponds:<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> the devil! if she should be there this evening
my heart's broke.</p></div>

<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Jolly</span>.
</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> That must be Sir Davy; ay, that's he,
that's he, ha, ha, ha; was ever the like heard of? was
ever anything so pleasant?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> I'll lock her up three days and three
nights without meat, drink, or light; I'll humble her
in the devil's name.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Well, could I but meet my friend Sir
Davy, it would be the joyfullest news for him&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Who's there that has anything to say to
me?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Ah, my friend of friends, such news, such
tidings!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> I have lost my wife, man.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Lost her! she's not dead, I hope?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Yes. Alas, she's dead, irrecoverably lost!</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Why, I parted with her within this half-hour.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Did you so? are you sure it was she?
where was it? I'll have my lord chief-justice's warrant
and a constable presently.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> And she made the purest sport now with
a young fellow, man, that she met withal accidentally.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> O Lord, that's worse and worse! a
young fellow!&mdash;my wife making sport with a young
fellow! O Lord! here are doings, here are vagaries!
I'll run mad. I'll climb Bow-steeple presently, bestride
the dragon, and preach cuckoldom to the whole city.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> The best of all was, too, that it happened
to be an idle coxcomb that pretended to be in love
with her, neighbour.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Indeed! in love with her! who was it?
what's his name? I warrant you won't tell a body&mdash;I'll
indict him in the Crown-office; no, I'll issue
warrants to apprehend him for treason upon the
statute of Edward 19. Won't you tell me what
young fellow it was? was it a very handsome young
fellow, ha?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Handsome? yes, hang him; the fellow's
handsome enough: he is not very handsome neither,
but he has a devilish leering black eye.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> O Lord!</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> His face too is a good riding face; 'tis no
soft effeminate complexion indeed, but his countenance
is ruddy, sanguine, and cheerful; a devilish
fellow in a corner, I'll warrant him.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Bless us! what will become of me? Why
the devil did I marry a young wife? Is he very well
shaped too, tall, straight, and proportionable, ha?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Tall? no, he's not very tall neither, yet he
is tall enough too: he's none of your overgrown,
lubberly Flanders jades, but more of the true English
breed, well-knit, able, and fit for service, old boy; the
fellow is well shaped truly, very well proportioned,
strong and active. I have seen the rogue leap like a
buck.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Who can this be? Well, and what think
you, friend, has he been there? Come, come, I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
sensible she's a young woman; and I am an old
fellow&mdash;troth, a very old fellow, I signify little or
nothing now. But do you think he has prevailed?
am I cuckold, neighbour?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Cuckold! what, a cuckold in Covent-garden!
no, I'll assure you, I believe her to be the
most virtuous woman in the world; but if you had
but seen&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ay, would I had! what was it?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> How like a rogue she used him: first of
all comes me up the spark to her. "Madam," says
he&mdash;and then he bows down, thus. "How now," says
she, "what would the impertinent fellow have?"</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Humph! ha! well, and what then?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> "Madam," says he again, bowing as he
did before, "my heart is so entirely yours, that
except you take pity on my sufferings I must here
die at your feet."</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> So, and what said she again, neighbour?
ha!</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> "Go, you are a fop."</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ha, ha, ha! did she indeed? Did she
say so indeed? I am glad on't, troth, I am very glad
on't. Well, and what next? And how, and well, and
what? ha!</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> "Madam," says he, "this won't do; I am
your humble servant for all this; you may pretend to
be as ill-natured as you please, but I shall make bold."</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Was there ever such an impudent fellow?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> With that, "Sirrah," says she, "you are
a saucy jackanapes, and I'll have you kicked."</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ha, ha, ha! Well, I would not be unmarried
again to be an angel.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> But the best jest of all was, who this
should be at last.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ay, who indeed! I'll warrant you some
silly fellow or other, poor fool!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> E'en a scandalous rakehell, that lingers
up and down the town by the name of Captain
Beaugard; but he has been a bloody cuckold-making
scoundrel in his time.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Hang him, sot, is it he? I don't value
him this, not a wet finger, man. To my knowledge
she hates him, she scorns him, neighbour; I know
it, I am very well satisfied in the point; besides, I
have seen him since that, and out-hectored him:
I am to tell her from his own mouth, that he
promises never to affront her more.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ay, ay&mdash;</p></div>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> No faith, Sir Jolly, e'en go into my house
now, and stay supper with me, we ha'n't supped
together a great while.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Ha! say you so? I don't care if I do, faith,

to set all things right again.                            [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> My dear!</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Sir!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> You have been abroad, my dear, I see.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Only for a little air; truly I was almost
stifled within doors; I hope you will not be angry,
Sir Davy, will you?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Angry, child! no, child, not I; what
should I be angry for?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> I wonder, Sir Davy, you will serve me
at this rate. Did you not promise to go in my
behalf to Beaugard, and correct him according to
my instructions for his insolence?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> So I did, child; I have been with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
sweetheart; I have told him all to a tittle; I gave
him back again the picture too: but, as the devil
would have it, I forgot the ring&mdash;faith, I did.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Did you purpose, Sir Sodom, to render
me ridiculous to the man I abominate? what scandalous
interpretation, think you, must he make of
my retaining any trifle of his, sent me on so dishonourable
terms!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Really, my lamb, thou art in the right;
yet I went back afterwards, dear heart, and did the
business to some purpose.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> I am glad that you did, with all my
heart.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> I gave him his lesson, I'll warrant him.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Lesson! what lesson had you to give him?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Why, I told him as he liked that usage
he might come again; ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Ay, and so let him.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> With all my heart, I'll give him free
leave, or hang me; though thou wouldst not imagine
how the poor devil's altered. La you there now,
but as certainly as I stand here, that man is troubled
that he swears he shall not rest day nor night
till he has satisfied thee; pr'ythee be satisfied with
him if 'tis possible, my dear, pr'ythee do. I promised
him, before I left him, to tell thee as much: for the
poor wretch looks so simply, I could not choose but
pity him, I vow and swear, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Now, now, you little witch! now, you
chitsface! Odd, I could find in my heart to put my
little finger in your bubbies.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Sir Davy, I must tell you, that I cannot
but resent your so soon reconcilement with a man
that I hate worse than death, and that if you loved
me with half that tenderness which you profess, you
would not forget an affront so palpably and so basely
offered me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Why, chicken, where's the remedy?
What's to be done? How wouldst thou have me
deal with him?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Cut his throat.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Bless us for ever! cut his throat! what,
do murder?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Murder! yes, anything to such an incorrigible
enemy of your honour, one that has resolved
to persist in abusing of you. See here this letter,
this I received since I last parted with you; just
now it was thrown into my chair by an impudent
lackey of his, kept o' purpose for such employments.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Let me see: a letter, indeed!&mdash;"For the
Lady Dunce": damned rogue, treacherous dog,
what can he say in the inside now? here's a villain!</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Yes, you had best break it open, you
had so; 'tis like the rest of your discretion.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Lady, if I have an enemy, it is best for
me to know what mischief he intends me; therefore,
with your leave, I will break it open.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Do, do, to have him believe that I was
pleased enough with it to do it myself: if you have
the spirit of a gentleman in you, carry it back, and
dash it, as it is, in the face of that audacious fellow.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> What can be the meaning of this now?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> A gentleman! yes, madam, I am a
gentleman, and the world shall find that I am a
gentleman.&mdash;I have certainly the best woman in the
world.                                                    <span class="directline">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> What do you think must be the end of
all this? I have no refuge in the world but your
kindness: had I a jealous husband now, how miserable
must my life be!</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Ah, rogue's nose! ah, devil! ah, toad!
cunning thief, wheedling slut, I'll bite her by and by.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Poor fool! No, dear, I am not jealous, nor
never will be jealous of thee; do what thou wilt, thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
shalt not make me jealous: I love thee too well to
suspect thee.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Ah, but how long will you do so?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> How long? as long as I live, I warrant
thee, I&mdash;don't talk to a body so: I cannot hold if
thou dost, my eyes will run over, poor fool! poor
birdsnies! poor lambkin!</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> But will you be so kind to me to answer
my desires? will you once more endeavour to make
that traitor sensible that I have too just an esteem of
you not to value his addresses as they deserve?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ay, ay, I will.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> But don't stay away too long, dear;
make what haste you can; I shall be in pain till I
see you again.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> My dear, my love, my babby, I'll be with
thee in a moment. How happy am I above the rest
of men! Neighbour, dear neighbour, walk in with
my wife, and keep her company till I return again.
Child, don't be troubled, pr'ythee don't be troubled.&mdash;Was
there ever such a wife? well, da, da, da:

day's loss again? my honourable pimp too, my pander
knight has forsaken me; methinks I am quandaried,
like one going with a party to discover the enemy's
camp, but had lost his guide upon the mountains.
Curse on him, old Argus is here again; there can be
no good fortune towards me when he's at my heels.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Sir, sir, sir, one word with you, sir!
Captain, captain, noble captain, one word, I beseech
you.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> With me, friend?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Yes, with you, my no-friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Sir Davy, my intimate, my bosom-physician!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ah, rogue! damned rogue!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> My confessor, my dearest friend I ever had!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Dainty wheedle, here's a fellow for ye!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> One that has taught me to be in love with
virtue, and shown me the ugly inside of my follies.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Sir, your humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Is that all? if you are as cold in your
love as you are in your friendship, Sir Davy,
your lady has the worst time on't of any one in
Christendom.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> So she has, sir, when she cannot be free
from the impudent solicitations of such fellows as
you are, sir.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> As me, sir! why, who am I, good Sir
Domine Doddlepate?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> So, take notice he threatens me; I'll
have him bound to the peace instantly. Will you
never have remorse of conscience, friend? have you
banished all shame from your soul? Do you consider
my name is Sir Davy Dunce? that I have the most
virtuous wife living? do you consider that? Now
how like a rogue he looks again! what a hang-dog
leer was that!</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Your virtuous wife, sir! you are always
harping upon that string, Sir Davy.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> No, 'tis you would be harping upon that
string, sir: see you this? cast your eyes upon this,
this letter, sir. Did you not promise, this very day,
to abandon all manner of proceedings of this nature,
tending to the dishonour of me and my family?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Letter, sir! What the devil does he mean
now? Let me see, "For the Lady Dunce"; this is
no scrawl of mine, I'll be sworn; by Jove, her own
hand! what a dog was I! forty to one but I had
played the fool, and spoiled all again. Was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
ever so charming a creature breathing!&mdash;Did your
lady deliver this to your hands, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Even her own self in person, sir, and
bade me tell you, sir, that she has too just an esteem
of me, sir, not to value such a fellow as you are as
you deserve.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Very good: [<i>Reads</i>] "I doubt not but this
letter will surprise you"&mdash;in troth, and so it does
extremely&mdash;"but reflect upon the manner of conveying
it to your hand as kindly as you can."</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ay, a damned thief, to have it thrown
into the chair by a footman.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> [<i>Reads.</i>] "Would Sir Davy were but half
so kind to you as I am!"</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Say you so, you insinuating knave?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> [<i>Reads.</i>] "But he, I am satisfied, is so
severely jealous, that except you contrive some way
to let me see you this evening, I fear all will be
hopeless."</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Impudent traitor! I might have been a
monster yet, before I had got my supper in my
belly.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> [<i>Reads.</i>] "In order to which, either appear
yourself, or somebody for you, half an hour hence in the
Piazza, where more may be considered of. Adieu."</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Thanks to you, noble sir, with all my
heart; you are come, I see, accordingly; but, as a
friend, I am bound in conscience to tell you the
business won't do; the trick won't pass, friend; you
may put up your pipes, and march off. O Lord! he
lie with my wife! pugh&mdash;he make Sir Davy Dunce
a cuckold! poor wretch, ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Yes, sir, who desires you, by all means, to

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> It will be the greatest honour I ever

<p><i>Four.</i> Yes, sir, if your name be Sir Davy Dunce,
as I have the honour to be informed it is: he desires
you moreover to make what haste you can, for that
he has some matters of importance to communicate
to your honour, which may take up some time.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Communicate with me! he does me too

himself to invite me to supper; to confer with me too!
I shall certainly be a great man.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap"><i>Draw.</i></span> Welcome, gentlemen, very
welcome, sir; will you please to
walk up one pair of stairs?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Get the great room ready
presently; carry up too a good
stock of bottles before-hand, with
ice to cool our wine, and water to refresh our glasses.</p>

<p><i>Draw.</i> It shall be done, sir.&mdash;Coming, coming
there, coming: speak up in the Dolphin, somebody. <span class="directline">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p></div>

<p class="directright"></p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Beau.</i> Ah, Courtine, must we be always idle? must
we never see our glorious days again? when shall we
be rolling in the lands of milk and honey; encamped
in large luxuriant vineyards, where the loaded vines
cluster about our tents; drink the rich juice, just
pressed from the plump grape; feeding on all the
fragrant golden fruit that grow in fertile climes, and
ripened by the earliest vigour of the sun?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Ah, Beaugard, those days have been, but
now we must resolve to content ourselves at an
humble rate. Methinks it is not unpleasant to consider
how I have seen thee in a large pavilion,
drowning the heat of the day in champagne wines,
sparkling sweet as those charming beauties whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
dear remembrance every glass recorded, with half a
dozen honest fellows more; friends, Beaugard;
faithful hearty friends; things as hard to meet with
as preferment here; fellows that would speak truth
boldly, and were proud on't; that scorned flattery,
loved honesty, for 'twas their portion; and never yet
learned the trade of ease and lying: but now&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> And now we are at home in our natural
hives, and sleep like drones; but there's a gentleman
on the other side the water,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> that may make work for
us all one day.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> But in the meanwhile&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> In the meanwhile patience, Courtine; that
is the Englishman's virtue. Go to the man that
owes you money, and tell him you are necessitated;
his answer shall be "A little patience, I beseech you,
sir." Ask a cowardly rascal satisfaction for a sordid
injury done you; he shall cry, "Alas-a-day, sir, you
are the strangest man living, you won't have patience
to hear one speak." Complain to a great man that
you want preferment, that you have forsaken considerable
advantages abroad, in obedience to public
edicts; all you shall get of him is this, "You must
have patience, sir."</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> But will patience feed me, or clothe me, or
keep me clean?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Pr'ythee no more hints of poverty: 'tis
scandalous; 'sdeath, I would as soon choose to hear a
soldier brag as complain. Dost thou want any money?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> True, indeed, I want no necessaries to keep
me alive; but I do not enjoy myself with that freedom
I would do; there is no more pleasure in living
at stint, than there is in living alone. I would have
it in my power, when he needed me, to serve and
assist my friend; I would to my ability deal handsomely
too by the woman that pleased me.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
<p><i>Beau.</i> Oh, fie for shame! you would be a whore-master,
friend; go, go, I'll have no more to do with you.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> I would not be forced neither at any time to
avoid a gentleman that had obliged me, for want of
money to pay him a debt contracted in our old
acquaintance: it turns my stomach to wheedle with
the rogue I scorn, when he uses me scurvily, because
he has my name in his shop-book.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> As, for example, to endure the familiarities
of a rogue that shall cock his greasy hat in my face,
when he duns me, and at the same time vail it<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> to an
over-grown deputy of the ward, though a frowzy
fellmonger.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> To be forced to concur with his nonsense
too, and laugh at his parish-jests.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> To use respects and ceremonies to the milchcow
his wife, and praise her pretty children, though
they stink of their mother, and are uglier than the
issue of a baboon; yet all this must be endured.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Must it, Beaugard?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> And, since 'tis so, let's think of a bottle.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> With all my heart, for railing and drinking
do much better together than by themselves; a
private room, a trusty friend or two, good wine and
bold truths, are my happiness. But where's our dear
friend and intimate, Sir Jolly, this evening?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> To deal like a friend, Courtine, I parted
with him but just now; he's gone to contrive me a
meeting, if possible, this night, with the woman my
soul is most fond of. I was this evening just entering
upon the palace of all joy, when I met with so damnable
a disappointment&mdash;in short, that plague to all
well-meaning women, the husband, came unseasonably,
and forced a poor lover to his heels, that was
fairly making his progress another way, Courtine:
the story thou shalt hear more at large hereafter.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
<p><i>Cour.</i> A plague on him, why didst thou not murder
the presumptuous cuckold? saucy intruding clown,
to dare to disturb a gentleman's privacies! I would
have beaten him into sense of his transgression,
enjoyed his wife before his face, and ha' taught the dog
his duty.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Look you, Courtine, you think you are
dealing with the landlord of your winter-quarters in
Alsatia now. Friend, friend, there is a difference
between a free-born English cuckold and a sneaking
wittol of a conquered province.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Oh, by all means, there ought to be a difference
observed between your arbitrary whoring, and
your limited fornication.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> And but reason: for, though we may make
bold with another man's wife in a friendly way, yet
nothing upon compulsion, dear heart.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> And now Sir Jolly, I hope, is to be the
instrument of some immortal plot; some contrivance
for the good of thy body, and the old fellow's soul,
Beaugard: for all cuckolds go to Heaven, that's
most certain.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Sir Jolly! why, on my conscience, he thinks
it as much his undoubted right to be pimp-mastergeneral
to London and Middlesex, as the estate he
possesses is: by my consent his worship should e'en
have a patent for it.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> He is certainly the fittest for the employment
in Christendom; he knows more families by
their names and titles than all the bell-men within
and without the walls.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Nay, he keeps a catalogue of the choicest
beauties about town, illustrated with a particular
account of their age, shape, proportion, colour of hair
and eyes, degrees of complexion, gunpowder spots
and moles.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> I wish the old pander were bound to satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
my experience, what marks of good-nature my Sylvia
has about her.</p></div>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> My captains! my sons of Mars and imps
of Venus! well encountered; what, shall we have a
sparkling bottle or two, and use Fortune like a jade?
Beaugard, you are a rogue, you are a dog, I hate
you; get you gone, go.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> But, Sir Jolly, what news from paradise
Sir Jolly? Is there any hopes I shall come there to-night?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> May be there is, may be there is not; I
say let us have a bottle, and I will say nothing else
without a bottle: after a glass or two my heart may
open.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Why, then we will have a bottle, Sir Jolly.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Will? we'll have dozens, and drink till we
are wise, and speak well of nobody; till we are
lewder than midnight whores, and out-rail disbanded
officers.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Only one thing more, my noble knight, and
then we are entirely at thy disposal.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Well, and what's that? What's the
business?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> This friend of mine here stands in need of
thy assistance; he's damnably in love, Sir Jolly.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> In love! is he so? In love! odds my life!
Is she? what's her name? where does she live? I
warrant you I know her: she's in my table-book, I'll
warrant you: virgin, wife, or widow? <span class="directline">[<i>Pulls out a table-book.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> In troth, Sir Jolly, that's something of a
difficult question; but, as virgins go now, she may
pass for one of them.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Virgin, very good: let me see; virgin,
virgin, virgin; oh, here are the virgins; truly, I meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
with the fewest of this sort of any. Well, and the
first letter of her name now? for a wager I guess her.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Then you must know, Sir Jolly, that I love
my love with an S.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> S, S, S, oh, here are the Esses; let me
consider now&mdash;Sappho?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> No, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Selinda?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Neither.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Sophronia?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> You must guess again, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Sylvia?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Ay, ay, Sir Jolly, that's the fatal name;
Sylvia the fair, the witty, the ill-natured; do you
know her, my friend?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Know her! why, she is my daughter, and I
have adopted her these seven years. Sylvia! let me
look. [<i>Reads.</i>] "Light brown hair, her face oval, and
nose Roman, quick sparkling eyes, plump, pregnant,
ruby lips, with a mole on her breast, and the perfect
likeness of a heart-cherry on her left knee." Ah, villain!
ah, sly-cap! have I caught you? are you there,
i'faith? well, and what says she? Is she coming?
do her eyes betray her? does her heart beat, and her
bubbies rise, when you talk to her, ha?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Look you, Sir Jolly, all things considered, it
may make a shift to come to a marriage in time.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> I'll have nothing to do in it; I won't be
seen in the business of matrimony. Make me a
match-maker, a filthy marriage-broker! sir, I scorn
it, I know better things. Look you, friend, to carry
her a letter from you or so, upon good terms, though
it be in a church, I'll deliver it; or when the business
is come to an issue, if I may bring you handsomely
together, and so forth, I'll serve thee with all my soul,
and thank thee into the bargain; thank thee heartily,
dear rogue; I will, you little cock-sparrow, faith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>

wine hither. [<i>Exit</i> Drawer, <i>who returns with wine</i>.]
So&mdash;[<i>sits down</i>]&mdash;from this moment, war, war, and
mortal dudgeon against that enemy of my honour,
and thief of my good name, called Beaugard. You
can cut a throat upon occasion you say, friend?</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Sir, cutting of throats is my hereditary vocation;
my father was hanged for cutting of throats
before me, and my mother for cutting of purses.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> No more to be said; my courage is
mounted like a little Frenchman upon a great horse,
and I'll have him murdered.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Sir! murdered you say, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ay, murdered I say, sir; his face flayed
off, and nailed to a post in my great hall in the
country, amongst all the other trophies of wild beasts
slain by our family since the Conquest; there's never
a whore-master's head there yet.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Sir, for that let me recommend this worthy
friend of mine to your service; he's an industrious
gentleman, and one that will deserve your favour.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> He looks but something ruggedly, though,
methinks.</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> But, sir, his parts will atone for his person;
forms and fashions are the least of his study: he
affects a sort of philosophical negligence indeed; but,
sir, make trial of him, and you'll find him a person
fit for the work of this world.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> What trade are you, friend?</p>

<p><i>Bloody-B.</i> No trade at all, friend; I profess murder;
rascally butchers make a trade on't; 'tis a gentleman's
divertisement.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Do you profess murder?</p>

<p><i>Bloody-B.</i> Yes, sir, 'tis my livelihood: I keep a
wife and six children by it.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Then, sir, here's to you with all my heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>Would I had done with these fellows!                      [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Well, sir, if you have any service for us, I

as soon as is possible.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Soft and fair, sweetheart; I love to see a
little how I lay out my money. Have you very good
trading now-a-days in your way, friend?</p>

<p><i>Bloody-B.</i> In peaceable times a man may eat and
drink comfortably upon't: a private murder done
handsomely is worth money; but now that the
nation's unsettled, there are so many general undertakers,
that 'tis grown almost a monopoly; you may
have a man murdered almost for little or nothing,
and nobody e'er know who did it neither.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Pray what countryman are you? where
were you born, most noble sir?</p>

<p><i>Bloody-B.</i> Indeed, my country is foreign. I was
born in Argier<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>; my mother was an apostate Greek,
my father a renegado Englishman, who by oppressing
of Christian slaves grew rich; for which, when he
lay sick, I murdered him one day in his bed; made
my escape to Malta, where, embracing the faith, I
had the honour given me to command a thousand
horse aboard the galleys of that state.</p>

the best ragout in the world: I have eaten

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Bless us! a man! and bloody! what,

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Two ruffians brought him in just now,
pronouncing the inhuman deed was done by your
command: Sir Jolly came in the same minute, or
sure I had died with my distracting fears. How
could you think on a revenge so horrid?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> As I hope to be saved, neighbour, I only
bargained with them to bastinado him in a way, or
so, as one friend might do to another: but do you
say that he is dead?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Dead, dead as clay; stark stiff and useless
all, nothing about him stirring, but all's cold and still.
I knew him a lusty fellow once, a very mettled fellow;
'tis a thousand pities!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> What shall I do? I'll throw myself upon
him, kiss his wide wounds, and weep till blind as
buzzard.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Oh, come not near him; there's such

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Dear neighbour, dearest neighbour, friend,
Sir Jolly, as you love charity, pity my wretched case,
and give me counsel; I'll give my wife and all my
estate to have him live again; or shall I bury him in
the arbour, at the upper end of the garden?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Alas-a-day, neighbour, never think on't,
never think on't; the dogs will find him there, as
they scrape holes to bury bones in; there is but one
way that I know of.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> What is it, dear neighbour, what is it?
You see I am upon my knees to you; take all I have
and ease me of my fears.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Truly the best thing that I can think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>is putting of him to bed, putting him into a warm
bed, and try to fetch him to life again; a warm bed
is the best thing in the world. My lady may do much
too, she's a good woman, and, as I've been told,
understands a green wound well.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> My dear, my dear, my dear!</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Bear me away! oh, send me hence far
off, where my unhappy name may be a stranger, and
this sad accident no more remembered to my dishonour!</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ah, but my love! my joy! are there no
bowels in thee?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> What would you have me do?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Pr'ythee do so much as try thy skill;
there may be one dram of life left in him yet. Take
him up to thy chamber, put him into thy own bed,
and try what thou canst do with him; pr'ythee do:
if thou canst but find motion in him, all may be well
yet. I'll go up to my closet in the garret, and say
my prayers in the mean while.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Will ye then leave this ruin on my
hands?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Pray, pray, my dear; I beseech you,
neighbour, help to persuade her if it be possible.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Faith, madam, do, try what you can do.
I have a great fancy you may do him good; who can
tell but you may have the gift of stroking? Pray,
madam, be persuaded.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> I'll do whate'er's your pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> That's my best dear: I'll go to my closet

think there is left, very little: there's nothing to be
done if you don't pray: get you to prayers whatever
you do. Get you gone; nay, don't stay now, shut
the window, I tell you.</p>

Edmundsbury Godfrey, the magistrate before whom Titus Oates
made his incredible depositions concerning the alleged Popish
plot. Many believed it was a case of suicide. He was found
pierced through with his own sword on Primrose Hill. But the
infamous Bedloe, a convicted felon, and accomplice of Titus
Oates, accused Queen Catharine's Catholic servants of murdering
Godfrey in Somerset House, where the queen then resided, and
so struck at the queen herself. Oates and he afterwards accused
her of conspiring to murder the king. But Charles was not so
mad and bad as to believe them. Godfrey had warned one of the
denounced persons, Coleman, and the murder, if it was one, is
now generally attributed to the Ultra-Protestant faction. At any
rate, they used the incident to inflame the public mind against the
Roman Catholics.</p></div>

you are.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Hast thou done this, my dear destruction?
and am I in thy limbo? I must confess, when I am
in my beer, my courage does run away with me now
and then; but let me loose, and thou shalt see what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
a gentle humble animal thou hast made me. Fie
upon't! what, tie me up like an ungovernable cur to
the frame of a table! let, let thy poor dog loose, that
he may fawn and make much of thee a little.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> What, with those paws which you have been
ferreting Moor-fields withal, and are very dirty still?
After you have been daggling<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> yourself abroad for
prey, and can meet with none, you come sneaking
hither for a crust, do you?</p>

<p><i>Maid.</i> Shall I fetch the whip and the bell, madam,
and slash him for his roguery soundly?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Indeed, indeed! Do you long to be ferking<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
of man's flesh, madam flea-trap? Does the chaplain of
the family use you to the exercise, that you are so
ready for it?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> If you should be let loose, and taken into
favour now, you would be for rambling again so soon
as you had got your liberty.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Do but try me, and if ever I prove recreant
more, let me be beaten and used like a dog in good
earnest.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Promise to grant me but one request, and it
shall be done.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Hear me but swear.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> That anybody may do ten thousand times
a-day.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Upon the word of a gentleman; nay, as I
hope to get money in pocket.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> There I believe him, lelely.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> You'll keep
your word, you say?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> If I don't, hang me up in that wench's old
garters.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> See, sir, you have your freedom.        <span class="directline">[<i>Unbinds him.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Well, now name the price; what I must pay
for't?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> You know, sir, considering our small acquaintance,
you have been pleased to talk to me very freely
of love-matters.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> I must confess, I have been something to
blame that way; but if ever thou hearest more of it
from my mouth after this night's adventure&mdash;would
I were well out of the house!</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Have a care of swearing, I beseech you; for
you must understand that, spite of my teeth, I am at
last fallen in love most unmercifully.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> And dost thou imagine I am so hard-hearted
a villain as to have no compassion of thee?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> No, for I hope he's a man you can have no
exceptions against.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Yes, yes, the man is a man, I'll assure you,
that's one comfort.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Who do you think it may be now? try if you
can guess him.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Whoever he is, he's an honest fellow, I'll
warrant him, and I believe will not think himself
very unhappy neither.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> If a fortune of five thousand pounds, pleasant
nights, and quiet days, can make him happy, I assure
you he may be so; but try once to guess at him.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> But if I should be mistaken?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Why, who is it you would wish me to?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> You have five thousand pound, you say?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Yes.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Faith, child, to deal honestly, I know well
enough who 'tis I wish for; but, sweetheart, before I
tell you my inclinations, it were but reasonable that
I knew yours.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Well, sir, because I am confident you will
stand my friend in the business, I'll make a discovery;
and to hold you in suspense no longer, you must
know I have a month's mind<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to an arm-full of your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>dearly-beloved friend and brother captain; what say
you to't?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Madam, your humble servant; good-bye,
that's all.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> What, thus cruelly leave a lady that so kindly
took you in, in your last night's pickle, into her
lodging? whither would you rove now, my wanderer?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Faith, madam, you have dealt so gallantly
in trusting me with your passion, that I cannot stay
here without telling you, that I am three times as
much in love with an acquaintance of yours, as you
can be with any friend of mine.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Not with my waiting-woman, I hope, sir.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> No, but it is with a certain kinswoman of
thine, child; they call her my Lady Dunce, and I
think this is her house too; they say she will be civil
upon a good occasion, therefore, pr'ythee be charitable,
and show the way to her chamber a little.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> What, commit adultery, captain? fie upon't!
what, hazard your soul?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> No, no, only venture my body a little, that's
all; look you, you know the secret, and may imagine
my desires, therefore as you would have me assist
your inclinations, pray be civil and help me to mine;
look you, no demurring upon the matter, no qualms,
but show me the way&mdash;[<i>To the</i> Maid] or you, hussy,
you shall do't; any bawd will serve at present, for I
will go.                                              <span class="directline">[<i>Exit</i> Maid.</span></p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> But you shan't go, sir.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Shan't go, lady?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> No, shan't go, sir; did I not tell you when
once you had got your liberty, that you would be
rambling again.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Why, child, wouldst thou be so uncharitable
to tie up a poor jade to an empty rack in thy stable,
when he knows where to go elsewhere, and get provender
enough?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Any musty provender, I find, will serve your
turn, so you have it but cheap, or at another man's
charges.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> No, child, I had rather my ox should graze
in a field of my own, than live hide-bound upon the
common, or run the hazard of being pounded every
day for trespasses.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Truly, all things considered, 'tis a great pity
so good a husbandman as you should want a farm to
cultivate.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Wouldst thou be but kind, and let me have
a bargain in a tenement of thine, to try how it would
agree with me!</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> And would you be contented to take a lease
for your life?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> So pretty a lady of the manor, and a moderate
rent!</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Which you'll be sure to pay very
punctually?</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> If thou doubtest my honesty, faith, e'en take
a little earnest beforehand.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Not so hasty neither, good tenant. <i>Imprimis</i>,
you shall oblige yourself to a constant residence, and
not, by leaving the house uninhabited, let it run to
repairs.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Agreed.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> <i>Item</i>, for your own sake you shall promise to
keep the estate well fenced and inclosed, lest some
time or other your neighbour's cattle break in and
spoil the crop on the ground, friend.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Very just and reasonable, provided I don't
find it lie too much to common already.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> <i>Item</i>, you shall enter into strict covenant not
to take any other farm upon your hands, without my
consent and approbation; or, if you do, that then it
shall be lawful for me to get me another tenant, how
and where I think fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Faith, that's something hard though, let me
tell you but that, landlady.</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Upon these terms, we'll draw articles.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> And when shall we sign them?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> Why, this morning, as soon as the ten
o'clock office in Covent-garden is open.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> A bargain; but how will you answer your
entertainment of a drunken red-coat in your lodgings
at these unseasonable hours?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> That's a secret you will be hereafter obliged
to keep for your own sake; and for the family, your
friend Beaugard shall answer for us there.</p>

<p><i>Cour.</i> Indeed I fancied the rogue had mischief in
his head, he behaved himself so soberly last night:
has he taken a farm lately too?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> A trespasser, I believe, if the truth were
known, upon the provender you would fain have
been biting at just now.</p></div>

<p><i>Cour.</i> I hope they'll come, and catch me here:
well, now you have brought me into this condition,
what will you do with me, ha?</p>

<p><i>Sylv.</i> You won't be contented for awhile to be tied
up like a jade to an empty rack without hay, will you?</p>

me quickly, that if I light into strange hands they

</p>

<div class="dialog">

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> I cannot sleep, I shall never sleep again:
I have prayed too so long, that were I to be hanged
presently, I have never a prayer left to help myself:
I was no sooner lain down upon the bed just now,
and fallen into a slumber, but methought the devil
was carrying me down Ludgate-hill a-gallop, six
puny fiends with flaming fire-forks running before
him like link-boys, to throw me headlong into Fleetditch,
which seemed to be turned into a lake of fire
and brimstone: would it were morning!</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Truly, sir, it has been a very dismal night.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> But didst thou meet never a white thing
upon the stairs?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> No, sir, not I; but methoughts I saw our great
dog Towzer, with his brass collar on, stand at the
cellar-door as I came along the old entry.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> It could never be: Towzer has a chain;
had this thing a chain on?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> No, sir, no chain, but it had Towzer's eyes
for all the world.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> What, ugly, great, frightful eyes?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Ay, ay, huge saucer eyes, but mightily like
Towzer's.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> O Lord! O Lord! hark! hark!</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> What? what I beseech you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> What's that upon the stairs? Didst thou
hear nothing? Hist, hark, pat, pat, pat, hark, hey!</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Hear nothing! where, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Look! look! what's that? what's that in
the corner there?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Where?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> There.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> What, upon the iron chest?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> No, the long black thing up by the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
clock-case. See! see! now it stirs, and is coming this
way.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Alas, sir, speak to it&mdash;you are a justice o'
peace&mdash;I beseech you. I dare not stay in the house:
I'll call the watch, and tell 'em hell's broke loose;
what shall I do? oh!                                       [<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> O Vermin, if thou art a true servant,
have pity on thy master, and do not forsake me in
this distressed condition. Satan, begone! I defy thee.
I'll repent and be saved, I'll say my prayers, I'll go
to church; help! help! help! Was there anything
or no? in what hole shall I hide myself?                   [<i>Exit.</i></p></div>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> That should be Sir Davy's voice; the

could not sleep. Pretty fellows, pretty fellows both;
you've done your business handsomely; what, I'll
warrant you have been a-whoring together now; ha!
You do well, you do well, I like you the better for't;
what's o'clock?</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> Near four, sir; 'twill not be day yet these
two hours.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Very well, but how got ye into the house?</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> A ragged retainer of the family, Vermin I
think they call him, let us in as physicians sent for
by your order.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Excellent rogues! and then I hope all
things are ready, as I gave directions?</p>

<p><i>Four.</i> To a tittle, sir; there shall not be a more
critical observer of your worship's pleasure than your
humble servant the Chevalier Fourbin.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Get you gone, you rogue, you have a
sharp nose, and are a nimble fellow; I have no more
to say to you, stand aside, and be ready when I call:

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Alas, unhappy man! I am thy friend.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Thou canst not be my friend, for I defy
thee. Sir Jolly! neighbour! ha! is it you? are you
sure it is you? are you yourself? if you be, give me
your hand. Alas-a-day, I ha' seen the devil.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> The devil, neighbour?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ay, ay, there's no help for't; at first I
fancied it was a young white bear's cub dancing in
the shadow of my candle; then it was turned to a
pair of blue breeches with wooden legs on, stamped
about the room, as if all the cripples in town had
kept their rendezvous there; when all of a sudden, it
appeared like a leathern serpent, and with a dreadful
clap of thunder flew out of the window.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Thunder! why, I heard no thunder.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> That may be too; what, were you asleep?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Asleep, quoth-a? no, no; no sleeping this
night for me, I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Well, what's the best news then? How
does the man?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Even as he did before he was born
nothing at all; he's dead.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Dead! what, quite dead?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> As good as dead, if not quite dead; 'twas
a horrid murder! and then the terror of conscience,
neighbour.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> And truly I have a very terrified one,
friend, though I never found I had any conscience
at all till now. Pray whereabout was his death's-wound?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Just here, just under his left pap, a dreadful
gash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> So very wide?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Oh, as wide as my hat; you might have
seen his lungs, liver, and heart, as perfectly as if you
had been in his belly.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Is there no way to have him privately
buried, and conceal this murder? Must I needs be
hanged by the neck like a dog, neighbour? Do I
look as if I would be hanged?</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Truly, Sir Davy, I must deal faithfully
with you, you do look a little suspiciously at present;
but have you seen the devil, say you?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ay, surely it was the devil, nothing else
could have frighted me so.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> Bless us, and guard us all the angels!

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Didst thou not see how the devils grinned
and gnashed their teeth at me, Vermin?</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Alas, sir, I was afraid one of 'em would have
bit off my nose, as he vanished out of the door.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Lead me away, I'll go to my wife, I'll
die by my own dear wife. Run away to the Temple,
and call Counsellor, my lawyer; I'll make over my
estate presently, I shan't live till noon; I'll give all
I have to my wife. Ha, Vermin!</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> Truly, sir, she's a very good lady.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Ah, much, much too good for me, Vermin;
thou canst not imagine what she has done for me,
man; she would break her heart if I should give any
thing away from her, she loves me so dearly. Yet if
I do die, thou shalt have all my old shoes.</p>

<p><i>Ver.</i> I hope to see you live many a fair day yet
though.</p>

<h3>SCENE III.&mdash;Lady <span class="smcap">Dunce's</span> <i>Chamber</i>.</h3>

<p class="directcenter">Lady <span class="smcap">Dunce</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Beaugard</span> <i>discovered</i>.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> What think you now of a cold wet
march over the mountains, your men tired, your
baggage not come up, but at night a dirty watery
plain to encamp upon, and nothing to shelter you,
but an old leaguer cloak as tattered as your colours?
Is not this much better, now, than lying wet, and
getting the sciatica?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> The hopes of this made all fatigue easy to
me; the thoughts of Clarinda have a thousand times
refreshed me in my solitude. Whene'er I marched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
I fancied still it was to my Clarinda; when I fought,
I imagined it was for my Clarinda; but when I came
home, and found Clarinda lost!&mdash;How could you
think of wasting but a night in the rank, surfeiting
arms of this foul-feeding monster, this rotten trunk
of a man, that lays claim to you?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> The persuasion of friends, and the
authority of parents.</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> And had you no more grace than to be
ruled by a father and mother?</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> When you were gone, that should have
given me better counsel, how could I help myself?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> Methinks, then, you might have found out
some cleanlier shift to have thrown away yourself upon
than nauseous old age, and unwholesome deformity.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> What, upon some over-grown, full-fed
country fool, with a horse-face, a great ugly head,
and a great fine estate; one that should have been
drained and squeezed, and jolted up and down the
town in hackneys with cheats and hectors, and so
sent home at three o'clock every morning, like a
lolling booby, stinking, with a belly-full of stummed
wine,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and nothing in's pockets?</p>

<p><i>Beau.</i> You might have made a tractable beast of
such a one; he would have been young enough for
training.</p>

<p><i>L. Dunce.</i> Is youth then so gentle, if age be stubborn?
Young men, like springs wrought by a subtle
workman, easily ply to what their wishes press them;
but the desire once gone that kept them down, they
soon start straight again, and no sign's left which way
they bent before.</p>

<p><i>Sir Jol.</i> [<i>At the door peeping.</i>] So, so, who says

whither would you go? I tell you, you shall not stir
one foot farther, man; the devil take me if you do.
Ghost! pr'ythee, here's no ghost at all; a little flesh

some alive, some dead, and so forth; but ghost! pish,
here's no ghost.</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> But, sir, if I say I did see a ghost, I did
see a ghost, an you go to that; why, sure I know a
ghost when I see one. Ah, my dear, if thou hadst but
seen the devil half so often as I have seen him!</p>

your too fierce resentment&mdash;</p>

him; would he had lain with my wife in every house
between Charing Cross and Aldgate, so this had
never happened!</p>

all mortal, neighbour, all mortal; to-day we are here,

your lady stayed with me at my house for one day,

you, my dearest, there is but one way for us to get

<p><i>Const.</i> Was it committed here near hand?</p>

<p><i>Sir Dav.</i> Oh, at the very next door; a sad murder
indeed. After they had done, they carried the body
privately into my neighbour Sir Jolly's house here;
I am sorry to tell it you, Master Constable, for I am
afraid it will look but scurvily on his side; though I
am a justice o' peace, gentlemen, and am bound by
my oath to take notice of it; I can't help it.</p>

so; justice must have its course; the king's liege subjects

<span class="i0">Pleased with her freedom she began to sing;<br /></span>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Venice</span> Preserved was written and
acted in 1682, when the terrors of
the alleged Popish Plot had nearly
subsided, and probably receives its
second title from that atrocious and
equivocal scare. It is founded on the
historical novel of Saint-R&eacute;al, <i>Conjuration</i>
<i>des Espagnols contre la Venise</i>
<i>en 1618</i>, though Sir Henry Wotton,
who was our ambassador to Venice at the time, calls it
a French conspiracy. The whole thing was kept as
dark as possible by the Republic, and its exact character
is not easy to determine. Mr. Horatio Brown,
however, by original researches in the Venetian archives,
has thrown much light upon it in his recent charming
volume of <i>Venetian Sketches</i>. Needy French adventurers,
like Pierre and Renault, appear to have inflamed the
ambition of Spanish grandees, like Osorio, Viceroy of
Naples, and Bedamar, the ambassador at Venice, to
compass the ruin of the Republic by taking advantage of
gross internal corruption, the glaring contrast between
social luxury and poverty, and consequent political discontent.
But it was a rat-like hole-and-corner plot, as
devoid of civic virtue or dignity, as any Rye House plot of
Otway's time, or any American-Irish assassination club of
our own.</p>

<p>The last time the play was performed without the
omission of the comic scenes, in which Antonio so
degradingly figures, was at the special command of
George II.; but they were condemned by the audience in
spite of royal influence. The satire upon Shaftesbury,
designed in the character of Antonio, is said to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
introduced at the instigation of Charles II. (Derrick,
<i>Dramatic Censor</i>, p. 2). In the prologue to the play,
Shaftesbury's ambition to be elected King of Poland,
which procured for him the nick-name of "Count
Tapsky," and was ridiculed by Dryden in <i>The Medal</i>,
is openly referred to. Antonio's name and age also
correspond to those of Shaftesbury. But the parody of
his style of speaking is poor. The audience on the
occasion just referred to bestowed vehement applause on
Leigh and Mrs. Currer, who acted the parts of Antonio
and Aquilina. So fond were people of buffoonery in those
days that, according to Davies (<i>Dramatic Miscellany</i>),
when Pierre, defying the conspirators (Act III.), exclaims&mdash;"Thou
die! Thou kill my friend! or thou, or thou, or
thou with that lean, withered, wretched face!"&mdash;an actor,
selected for the purpose, of a most unfortunate figure
and meagre visage, presented himself, and converted this
fine passage into burlesque.</p>

<p>The play of <i>Venice Preserved</i> has been several times
translated into French. Hallam observes that the
<i>Manlius Capitolinus</i> of Antoine de la Fosse, published in
1698, and imitated from <i>Venice Preserved</i>, shows the influence
which Otway exercised abroad. Upon himself the
influence of contemporary French dramatists was in turn
very marked. Lord Byron was certainly indebted to this
play in his <i>Marino Faliero</i>. An old French critic finds
fault with the tolling of the bell in Act V. "This shocking
extravagance, which in Paris would excite only contempt
and derision, strikes the English with awe." How
fashions change! Think of Victor Hugo and <i>Lucrezia</i>
<i>Borgia</i>!</p>

<p>Hallam remarked that <i>Venice Preserved</i> had been more
frequently seen on the stage than any other play, except
those of Shakespeare. He relates that when he saw it he
was affected almost to agony. According to Mr. Archer
(<i>Reign of Victoria. Drama</i>), <i>Venice Preserved</i> was performed
under Macready at Covent Garden between 1837 and
1839. It was revived at Sadler's Wells in 1845, with
Phelps as Jaffier, and Mrs. Warner as Belvidera.</p>

world know how entirely your
Grace's goodness has devoted a
poor man to your service; were
there words enough in speech to
express the mighty sense I have
of your great bounty towards me,
surely I should write and talk of
it for ever: but your Grace has given me so large a
theme, and laid so very vast a foundation, that imagination
wants stock to build upon it. I am as one dumb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>when I would speak of it; and when I strive to write,
I want a scale of thought sufficient to comprehend the
height of it.</p>

<p>Forgive me, then, madam, if (as a poor peasant once
made a present of an apple to an emperor) I bring this
small tribute, the humble growth of my little garden, and
lay it at your feet. Believe it is paid you with the utmost
gratitude; believe that so long as I have thought to
remember how very much I owe your generous nature,
I will ever have a heart that shall be grateful for it too:
your Grace, next Heaven, deserves it amply from me;
that gave me life, but on a hard condition&mdash;till your
extended favour taught me to prize the gift, and took
the heavy burthen it was clogged with from me; I mean
hard fortune. When I had enemies, that with malicious
power kept back and shaded me from those royal beams
whose warmth is all I have, or hope to live by, your noble
pity and compassion found me, where I was far cast
backward from my blessing, down in the rear of fortune;
called me up, placed me in the shine, and I have felt its
comfort. You have in that restored me to my native
right; for a steady faith, and loyalty to my prince, was
all the inheritance my father left me: and however hardly
my ill fortune deal with me, 'tis what I prize so well that
I ne'er pawned it yet, and hope I ne'er shall part with it.</p>

<p>Nature and fortune were certainly in league when you
were born; and as the first took care to give you beauty
enough to enslave the hearts of all the world, so the
other resolved, to do its merit justice, that none but a
monarch, fit to rule that world, should e'er possess it;
and in it he had an empire. The young prince<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> you
have given him, by his blooming virtues, early declares
the mighty stock he came from; and as you have taken
all the pious care of a dear mother and a prudent
guardian to give him a noble and generous education,
may it succeed according to his merits and your wishes:
may he grow up to be a bulwark to his illustrious father,
and a patron to his loyal subjects; with wisdom and
learning to assist him, whenever called to his councils;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>to defend his right against the encroachments of republicans
in his senates; to cherish such men as shall be
able to vindicate the royal cause; that good and fit
servants to the crown may never be lost for want of a
protector. May he have courage and conduct, fit to
fight his battles abroad, and terrify his rebels at home;
and that all these may be yet more sure, may he never,
during the spring-time of his years, when those growing
virtues ought with care to be cherished, in order to their
ripening;&mdash;may he never meet with vicious natures, or
the tongues of faithless, sordid, insipid flatterers, to blast
them. To conclude, may he be as great as the hand
of fortune (with his honour) shall be able to make him;
and may your Grace, who are so good a mistress, and so
noble a patroness, never meet with a less grateful servant
than,</p>

please, that I am a senator, and when I think fit can
make speeches, Madonna. Hurry durry, I can make
a speech in the Senate-house, now and then, would
make your hair stand on end, Madonna.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> The character of Antonio is a satire upon Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper
(b. 1621), one of the greatest Liberal statesmen of his
time, but unscrupulous, machiavellic, and shifty. Mulgrave
(<i>Essay on Satire</i>) calls him our little Machiavel; for his was the
"fiery soul which, working out its way, Fretted the pigmy body to
decay, And o'er-informed the tenement of clay" (Dryden's
<i>Absalom</i>). He was first a Royalist, then a Parliamentarian, later
contributed to the Restoration; after this a Tory, and finally a
Whig. He was a member of the "Cabal" administration, and
was created by Charles II. first Baron Ashley, and then Earl of
Shaftesbury. He was Lord Chancellor in 1672, and to him we
owe the Habeas Corpus Act; he also contributed materially to
make our judges independent of the Crown. He persecuted the
Catholics under pretext of the Popish Plot; promoted the
Exclusion Bill against the Duke of York, afterwards James II., as
a Catholic; and advocated Monmouth's (son of Charles II. by
Lucy Walters) claim to legitimacy. In 1681 he was impeached
and sent to the Tower on a charge of high treason, but acquitted.
He was, however, forced to retire to Holland, where he died
in 1683.</p></div>

<p>The following letters were first published among a collection
of <i>Familiar Letters by Lord Rochester and others</i>, &amp;c.
8vo, 1697; and were afterwards subjoined to an edition of
Otway's Works in 1727, under the title of "Love Letters."
They have no superscription, but are supposed to have
been written to Mrs. Barry, the actress.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Letter I.</span></h3>

<p>My Tyrant!</p>

<p>I endure too much torment to be silent, and have
endured it too long not to make the severest complaint.
I love you, I dote on you; desire makes me mad when
I am near you, and despair when I am from you. Sure,
of all miseries, love is to me the most intolerable: it
haunts me in my sleep, perplexes me when waking; every
melancholy thought makes my fears more powerful, and
every delightful one makes my wishes more unruly. In
all other uneasy chances of a man's life, there is an immediate
recourse to some kind of succour or another: in
wants we apply ourselves to our friends, in sickness to
physicians; but love, the sum, the total of all misfortunes,
must be endured with silence; no friend so dear to trust
with such a secret, nor remedy in art so powerful to
remove its anguish. Since the first day I saw you, I have
hardly enjoyed one hour of perfect quiet. I loved you
early; and no sooner had I beheld that soft bewitching
face of yours, but I felt in my heart the very foundation
of all my peace give way: but when you became another's
I must confess that I did then rebel, had foolish pride
enough to promise myself I would in time recover my
liberty: in spite of my enslaved nature, I swore, against
myself, I would not love you; I affected a resentment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
stifled my spirit, and would not let it bend so much as
once to upbraid you, each day it was my chance to see
or to be near you: with stubborn sufferance I resolved to
bear, and brave your power: nay, did it often too, successfully.</p>

<p>Generally with wine or conversation I diverted or
appeased the demon that possessed me; but when at
night, returning to my unhappy self, to give my heart an
account why I had done it so unnatural a violence, it was
then I always paid a treble interest for the short moments
of ease which I had borrowed; then every treacherous
thought rose up, and took your part, nor left me till they
had thrown me on my bed, and opened those sluices of
tears that were to run till morning. This has been for
some years my best condition: nay, time itself, that
decays all things else, has but increased and added to my
longings. I tell it you, and charge you to believe it, as
you are generous (which sure you must be, for everything,
except your neglect of me, persuades me that you are so),
even at this time, though other arms have held you, and
so long trespassed on those dear joys that only were my
due, I love you with that tenderness of spirit, that purity
of truth, and that sincerity of heart, that I could sacrifice
the nearest friends or interests I have on earth, barely but
to please you: if I had all the world, it should be yours;
for with it I could be but miserable, if you were not mine.</p>

<p>I appeal to yourself for justice, if through the whole
actions of my life I have done any one thing that might
not let you see how absolute your authority was over me.
Your commands have been always sacred to me; your
smiles have always transported me, and your frowns awed
me. In short, you will quickly become to me the greatest
blessing, or the greatest curse, that ever man was doomed
to. I cannot so much as look on you without confusion;
wishes and fears rise up in war within me, and work a
cursed distraction through my soul, that must, I am sure,
in time, have wretched consequences: you only can, with
that healing cordial, love, assuage and calm my torments.
Pity the man then that would be proud to die for you, and
cannot live without you; and allow him thus far to boast
too, that (take out fortune from the balance) you never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
were beloved or courted by a creature that had a nobler
or juster pretence to your heart than the unfortunate
and (even at this time) weeping</p>

<p class="right">OTWAY.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Letter II.</span></h3>

<p>In value of your quiet, though it would be the utter ruin
of my own, I have endeavoured this day to persuade
myself never more to trouble you with a passion that has
tormented me sufficiently already; and is so much the
more a torment to me, in that I perceive it is become one
to you, who are much dearer to me than myself. I have
laid all the reasons my distracted condition would let me
have recourse to before me; I have consulted my pride,
whether, after a rival's possession, I ought to ruin all my
peace for a woman that another has been more blest in,
though no man ever loved as I did;&mdash;but love, victorious
love! o'erthrows all that, and tells me it is his nature never
to remember; he still looks forward from the present
hour, expecting still new dawns, new rising happiness;
never looks back, never regards what is past and left
behind him, but buries and forgets it quite in the hot
fierce pursuit of joy before him. I have consulted too my
very self, and find how careless nature was in framing me;
seasoned me hastily with all the most violent inclinations
and desires, but omitted the ornaments that should make
those qualities become me. I have consulted too my lot of
fortune, and find how foolishly I wish possession of what
is so precious all the world's too cheap for it; yet still I
love, still I dote on, and cheat myself, very content, because
the folly pleases me. It is pleasure to think how fair you
are, though, at the same time, worse than damnation to
think how cruel. Why should you tell me you have shut
your heart up for ever? It is an argument unworthy of
yourself, sounds like reserve, and not so much sincerity as
sure I may claim even from a little of your friendship.</p>

<p>Can your age, your face, your eyes, and your spirit bid
defiance to that sweet power? No, you know better
to what end Heaven made you; know better how to
manage youth and pleasure, than to let them die and pall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
upon your hands. 'Tis me, 'tis only me you have barred
your heart against. My sufferings, my diligence, my
sighs, complaints, and tears, are of no power with your
haughty nature: yet sure you might at least vouchsafe to
pity them, not shift me off with gross, thick, homespun
friendship, the common coin that passes betwixt worldly
interests&mdash;must that be my lot? Take it, ill-natured, take
it; give it to him who would waste his fortune for you;
give it the man would fill your lap with gold, court you
with offers of vast rich possessions; give it the fool that
has nothing but his money to plead for him: love will
have a much nearer relation, or none. I ask for glorious
happiness; you bid me welcome to your friendship: it is like
seating me at your side-table, when I have the best pretence
to your right hand at the feast. I love, I dote, I am mad,
and know no measure; nothing but extremes can give me
ease, the kindest love, or most provoking scorn.</p>

<p>Yet even your scorn would not perform the cure: it might
indeed take off the edge of hope, but damned despair will
gnaw my heart for ever. If then I am not odious to your
eyes, if you have charity enough to value the well-being of
a man that holds you dearer than you can the child your
bowels are most fond of, by that sweet pledge of your first
softest love, I charm and here conjure you to pity the
distracting pangs of mine; pity my unquiet days and
restless nights; pity the frenzy that has half possessed my
brain already, and makes me write to you thus ravingly:
the wretch in Bedlam is more at peace than I am; and
if I must never possess the heaven I wish for, my next
desire is (and the sooner the better) a clean-swept cell, a
merciful keeper, and your compassion when you find me
there.</p>

<p class="center">Think and be generous.

<h3><span class="smcap">Letter III.</span></h3>

<p>Since you are going to quit the world<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> I think myself
obliged, as a member of that world, to use the best of my
endeavours to divert you from so ill-natured an inclination:
therefore, by reason your visits will take up so much of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>this day, I have debarred myself the opportunity of
waiting on you this afternoon, that I may take a time you
are more mistress of, and when you shall have more
leisure to hear, if it be possible for any arguments of mine
to take place in a heart I am afraid too much hardened
against me. I must confess it may look a little extraordinary
for one under my circumstances to endeavour the
confirming your good opinion of the world, when it had
been much better for me, one of us had never seen it; for
nature disposed me from my creation to love, and my
ill-fortune has condemned me to dote on one who certainly
could never have been deaf so long to so faithful a passion
had nature disposed her from her creation to hate anything
but me. I beg you to forgive this trifling, for I have so
many thoughts of this nature that 'tis impossible for me to
take pen and ink in my hand and keep them quiet,
especially when I have the least pretence to let you know
you are the cause of the severest disquiets that ever
touched the heart of</p>

<p class="right">OTWAY.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Letter IV.</span></h3>

<p>Could I see you without passion, or be absent from you
without pain, I need not beg your pardon for this renewing
my vows, that I love you more than health, or any
happiness here or hereafter. Everything you do is a new
charm to me; and, though I have languished for seven long
tedious years of desire, jealously and despairing, yet every
minute I see you I still discover something new and more
bewitching. Consider how I love you; what would not I
renounce or enterprise for you! I must have you mine, or
I am miserable, and nothing but knowing which shall be
the happy hour can make the rest of my life that are [is]
to come tolerable. Give me a word or two of comfort, or
resolve never to look with common goodness on me more,
for I cannot bear a kind look, and after it a cruel denial.
This minute my heart aches for you; and, if I cannot have
a right in yours, I wish it would ache till I could complain
to you no longer.</p>

<p class="right">Remember poor OTWAY.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Letter V.</span></h3>

<p>You cannot but be sensible that I am blind, or you
would not so openly discover what a ridiculous tool you
make of me. I should be glad to discover whose satisfaction
I was sacrificed to this morning; for I am sure
your own ill-nature could not be guilty of inventing such
an injury to me, merely to try how much I could bear,
were it not for the sake of some ass that has the fortune
to please you. In short, I have made it the business of
my life to do you service and please you, if possible by
any way to convince you of the unhappy love I have for
seven years toiled under; and your whole business is to
pick ill-natured conjectures out of my harmless freedom of
conversation, to vex and gall me with, as often as you are
pleased to divert yourself at the expense of my quiet. O
thou tormenter! Could I think it were jealousy, how
should I humble myself to be justified! But I cannot bear
the thought of being made a property either of another
man's good fortune or the vanity of a woman that designs
nothing but to plague me.</p>

<p>There may be means found, some time or other, to let
you know your mistaking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Letter VI.</span></h3>

<p>You were pleased to send me word you would meet me
in the Mall this evening, and give me further satisfaction
in the matter you were so unkind to charge me with: I
was there, but found you not; and therefore beg of you,
as you ever would wish yourself to be eased of the highest
torment it were possible for your nature to be sensible of,
to let me see you some time to-morrow, and send me
word, by this bearer, where, and at what hour, you will be
so just as either to acquit or condemn me; that I may,
hereafter, for your sake, either bless all your bewitching
sex, or, as often as I henceforth think of you, curse womankind
for ever.</p>

</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Mermaid Series</span> are being issued the best plays of the Elizabethan and
later dramatists&mdash;plays which, with Shakespeare's works, constitute the chief contribution
of the English spirit to the literature of the world. The Editors who
have given their assistance to the undertaking include men of literary eminence,
who have distinguished themselves in this field, as well as younger writers of
ability.</p>

<p>Each volume contains on an average five complete plays, prefaced by an Introductory
Notice of the Author. Great care is taken to ensure, by consultation
among the Editors, that the plays selected are in every case the <i>best</i> and most
representative&mdash;and not the most conventional, or those which have lived on a
merely accidental and traditional reputation. A feature will be made of plays by
little known writers, which although often so admirable are now almost inaccessible.
In every instance the utmost pains is taken to secure the best text, the
spelling is modernised, and brief but adequate notes are supplied. In no case do
the Plays undergo any process of expurgation. It is believed that, although they
may sometimes run counter to what is called modern taste, the free and splendid
energy of Elizabethan art, with its extreme realism and its extreme idealism&mdash;embodying,
as it does, the best traditions of the English Drama&mdash;will not suffer
from the frankest representation.</p>
